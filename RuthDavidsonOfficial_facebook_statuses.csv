Health boards are having to make huge savings in order to break even, to take out loans to keep going, and to put off essential repairs to hospital buildings. 

And yet we learn today - because of this government's failure to manage staffing – there has been a 47% increase in agency nursing and midwifery staff.

I call that a scandal.

242829922425897_885720434803506,"You can read my post-election speech here:

Good afternoon.

First of all, let me congratulate every single candidate right across the United Kingdom – no matter their party – who was elected as a Member of Parliament last night and let me thank those who fought for what they believed in, but fell short.

All those newly elected, have shown themselves to be deserving of the honour of representing people across their constituencies, and I am sure they will all endeavour to do that task to the very best of the abilities.

Of course, I am particularly delighted that one of those MPs will continue to be David Mundell.

His victory last night is a phenomenal tribute to his hard work, his integrity and his devotion to Dumfriesshire, Clydesdale and Tweeddale.

Last night may well go down as possibly the most remarkable election night in Scottish political history.

Five years ago, not a single Scottish seat changed hands.

Last night, 50 did.

First of all, let me congratulate the SNP on what has been a stunning political success.

We are at opposite ends of the political scale, but no one should deny them their moment of victory. It is a great achievement.

And secondly, let me commiserate with many of the people whose jobs they have replaced. Long serving Labour and Liberal Democrat MPs, from Jim Murphy to Douglas Alexander, Charles Kennedy to Michael Moore have lost their seats.

They all gave great service to Scottish and British politics and many of us, from whatever political persuasion, will feel sorrow at their departure.

Politics rarely stays still, however, and already people will be asking what next? And I know that the most pressing question for many people in Scotland will be what last night's result means for our United Kingdom.

Those of who support the United Kingdom have to face facts. 56 of Scotland's 59 MPs now have as their guiding principle the belief that the United Kingdom should not exist and that our nation should be separated.

I made it clear earlier this year that, despite our hopes, the referendum last year did not settle Scotland's constitutional question.

The result last night only confirms that viewpoint. It is unsettled business.

Let me make one thing very clear this morning.

It is that the voice of the 2 million Scots who voted to keep our United Kingdom together just seven months ago will not be forgotten in the wake of this victory.

And I commit once again today to always speaking up on your behalf and always defending the decision you made last year to keep our country together.

I am very, very proud of this party this morning. We fought this election on two positive messages – keeping the economic recovery going and keeping our country together. Alone among the three pro-UK parties, the Scottish Conservatives attracted more people to our banner.

We asked people to vote for us, not out of tactics, but because it was a way of showing you supported our Union.

In their hundreds and thousands, people have responded.

That gives me a degree of confidence. The SNP will rightly claim the noise and the cheers today.

I want Scotland's silent pro-UK majority to know that we stand four-square behind you – and we're not going to leave your side.

I will work in this new political dawn to demonstrate why Scotland's place should remain at the heart of a United Kingdom that Scotland helped build and that Scotland has ownership of.

Now is a time for calm heads and strong resolve.

I spoke to the Prime Minister this morning and he recognises the size of his task is great.

He must keep this country on track with our economic recovery – a recovery which is lifting thousands of families out of poverty and back into work, and driving our nation forward.

But he must also seek to bring this country together.

Scotland, England, Wales and Northern Ireland.

He recognises – as I do – that Scotland has two governments and he is committed use his position as head of the government in Westminster, to bring greater power and, crucially, responsibility to the one at Holyrood.

Be in no doubt, Conservatives in government will honour our promise on further devolution and push forward with turning the Smith agreement into law.

Let us recognise, too, that remarkable election results last night were not confined to north of Gretna.

Scotland chose, just a few months ago, to remain part of a United Kingdom which determines its government from seats won across the whole UK. David Cameron will remain Prime Minister and I have no doubt in my mind that he is the right man for the job and thousands of Scots agree. He will work diligently to ensure that Scotland's two governments deliver for our country.

Where others may question legitimacy or endeavour to sow grievance, he will act respectfully and in recognition of Scotland's need for change.

The Conservative and Unionist Party will always speak for every part of our United Kingdom.

Not out of tactics, or for political gain, but because we believe in it head, hard, body and soul.

Strengthening our devolved nations and strengthening our enduring union will be our task.

We will not shirk from it.

Thank you.",,status,,2015-05-08 09:04:27,660,145,57,660,0,0,0,0,0

""Good afternoon everybody.

""It's 17 days to go until the polling stations open.

""We're right at the business end of the campaign for the most important general election in a quarter of a century.

""The choices we make, the votes we cast will have a profound influence on the very nature and makeup of this country.

""From tomorrow, postal votes will be landing on doormats across the majority of Scotland, perhaps up to a quarter of all votes will be cast by post.

""Decisions are being made now, which will have consequences for decades to come.

""Me, I have always said that at this election – at any election – the only wasted vote is a vote that you don't believe in.

""So I say, up front and to any and all who'll listen that I want people to vote at this election for the party they believe in. To vote for the policies that they agree with. To vote for the Prime Minister they want. To vote for the best MP for their seat.

""I ask them to cast a positive vote.

""And there is no vote more positive than a vote for the Scottish Conservatives.

""We have entered this election campaign with two clear messages.

""Let's keep the economic recovery going and let's build on September's referendum result, moving the whole country forward together.

""So voters at this election face a clear and resounding choice

""…do we keep on track with our plan and say No Thanks to the Nationalists.

""…or go backwards with Labour and the SNP?

 

""The party that wants to break up the country, lording it over the party that would bankrupt our country….

""It's easy to dismiss this idea, or to look the other way.

""But this could not be more serious, and it is vital that we start spelling out for people exactly what it at stake.

""Since the turn of the year, I have been warning about a pact between the SNP and Labour. Of the demands a strident nationalist party would wring from a weak Labour one.

""I said in January that Ed Miliband and Nicola Sturgeon were half way down the aisle.

""Now in April, they're at the altar, preparing to exchange rings.

""Ed Miliband was asked four times on Friday whether he would rule out a deal. And he refused.

""On Saturday, Alex Salmond taunted him, saying he would be 'foolish' not to take one.

""So we need to confront what any such deal could mean.

""There is a genuine possibility that Scotland and Britain could wake up with a nightmare scenario on May the 8th.

""..Ed Miliband's Labour party with the largest number of seats.

""…with a crowd of SNP MPs desperate to take him over the line.

""And I'm asking people to think about what happens then.

""If this deal goes ahead, what will that mean for you, your family and the country?

""First of all, Prime Minister Miliband would immediately undo all the hard work of the last five years.

""Having halved the deficit, he'd turn the taps back on and wash that progress away.

""The tax breaks that have helped people and businesses find a way back from recession – gone.

""The steady hand on the tiller which has kept interest rates low and calmed the markets – gone.

""The confidence that Britain is on its way back and has put boom and bust behind it – gone.

""But –  worse – this would be a Labour government with Alex Salmond and Nicola Sturgeon wrestling for control of the steering wheel.

""Every day, looking for reasons and excuses to cause instability.

""Every day demanding more borrowing, more spending, trying to weaken our defences, threatening even to stop our soldiers' wages.

""…and every day, doing so in order to erode further our United Kingdom – the price of SNP support.

""Everything the SNP does is to bring Scotland closer to separation.

""Every inflated oil forecast, every made up piece of EU legal advice, every deal, every negotiation, every move they make is designed to bring Britain's break-up one step nearer.

""Holding a weak Labour leader to ransom is no different.

""The reality of what Scotland is facing is beginning to sink in.

""Of course Labour is trying to deny it – Ed Miliband has to while 41 Scottish Labour MPs are fighting for their lives. But we know what it is going on.

""And now Angela Eagles has confirmed it. The moment those Scottish Labour MPs are gone, Ed Miliband will be straight on the phone to Nicola Sturgeon asking for her opening bid.

 

""You know, I stood in the trenches last year with a number of  Labour MPs and MSPs who fought hard to keep our country together because they believed it to be worth fighting for.

""And I cannot imagine the betrayal they must feel from their own leadership to have the referendum result undermined – or perhaps even traded away  – in the courtship dance we're witnessing now.

""And while I am not surprised at all that the alarms are being sounded south of the border at the thought of such an unholy alliance, it is not the fears of my southern colleagues that are paramount in my mind right now.

""I have to say my real concerns are for people here, in Scotland…

""..for the quiet majority…

""..who voted No to independence last year..

""…who just want a sensible, straightforward government delivering some much needed security.

""…but who are looking on and wondering what on earth is happening.

""…confused at the prospect of a party intent on breaking up the UK government, holding power over it

""…who are astonished that it is the Labour party which might put them there.

""I have met countless people in the last few weeks on the campaign trail.

""Stopping me in supermarkets, on the escalators in shopping centres, or at street stalls across the country.

""People who thought the constitutional battle had been settled last year when the referendum result came in.

""They assumed – rightly – that we shouldn't have to constantly refight the battles of the past.

""That we could put all the division behind us and move forward together.

""I'm sorry to say to all those people I have met and countless more besides; This isn't settled.

""The Nationalists – who said it was once on a generation – have not honoured that commitment, rather strengthened their resolve to push for break up.

""And the fact is that a Labour party which many people put their trust in, has failed to respond to the challenge.

""…failed to remain upstanding for the Union for which Scotland voted last year.

""…and failed to answer the concerns of ordinary Scottish families who just want a party which seeks to be on their side.

""I look at the hollowed out shell of Scottish Labour and I don't even know what it stands for anymore.

""And I don't think it knows itself either.

""And that's what's most worrying.

""Because the SNP do know what they're about. They want independence. And they're prepared to use Ed Miliband to get it.

""They'll prop him up in power. They'll wait for the backlash in England.

""And then they'll stir division, resentment and anger South of the Border in the hope of driving us ever further apart.

""Of course, like Ed Miliband, Nicola Sturgeon denies this too. She wants to be a 'constructive force' to the UK state she seeks to destroy.

""Well, Nicola Sturgeon is an accomplished politician. She knows that the best way to win in two weeks' time is to de-risk the SNP.

""That's why she's touring London's TV studios pledging to be a positive partner to people across the UK. Surely it's time that Labour woke up and realised that the SNP's first and last priority will always be separation.

""If Nicola Sturgeon really wants to prove her constructive credentials, there's a test she has to meet. It's to accept – right now, before the election – that the United Kingdom is staying together for the next generation, in line with her own pledge, and in line the decision made by the people of Scotland last year.

 

""Otherwise, how can people all across the UK possibly be asked to believe a leader who claims to have the best interests at heart of a country which she still wants to break up?

 

***

""I don't want any of this for my country.

""And I'm convinced it's not what most ordinary people in Scotland want either.

""So where Labour has failed, I stand here today resolute.

""We, the Scottish Conservative and Unionist party, must shoulder a greater responsibility. We must now stand on behalf of those families today, Scottish and British, who want to see our country work for them, not split asunder …

""…we don't shy away from our time in government, we promote it

""…we don't quail from describing ourselves as Unionist, we are proud of it.

""We, the Scottish Conservatives, will seek to give a voice to Scotland's silent majority.

""…be the voice of those who want Scotland to remain anchored within the UK

""…be the voice of people who just want a strong economy to help them get on with their lives.

""…and be the voice of people who are afraid about their country's future – and want some basic leadership from those in charge.

""People want a party which says it straight.

""I promise so to do.

""So when it comes to a deal with the SNP?

""I say today what I said in September….

""No. Thanks.

…

""And I know what people will be asking.

""Can we, the Scottish Conservatives, be that party which will represent the quiet majority in Scotland?

""My answer is an unequivocal Yes.

""Already, we are the party that stands for majority opinion in Scotland on capping welfare.

""We are the party which, like most Scots, wants to bear down on the cost of government so we can help working families get a square deal.

""We are the party that stands with Scots who want a fairer, more prosperous country…

""…backing firms which pay a living wage, demanding more apprenticeships, and nurturing an economy that creates jobs.

""And we are the party with positive answers to our country's future.

""We will bring in a stronger Scottish Parliament with genuine powers on tax and spend.

""A deal which will bring stability and fairness to our United Kingdom.

""It's the right plan. It's the Unionist plan. And it's a plan which will expose the Nationalists and their fairytale economics for the small-minded, short-termist, divisive sect that they are.

""Can we do this? You're damned right….

""We can, we must, and we will.

""This is a party that is cowed no more. We're not apologising – the sackcloth and ashes have gone

""We're proud of our achievements in government and we're ready to serve again.

""So, to people in Scotland thinking about how to vote today – don't be cowed either.

""Don't be overwhelmed or lose faith.

""There is a positive alternative to the SNP, here ready to fight for you.

""It's a party whose time has come –

""A party ready to advance the cause of economic prosperity and our country's security.

""The Scottish Conservative and Unionist Party.

""So, I say to you today. Do not be daunted by the battles that lie ahead. Know that past conflict has instilled in us a renewed determination.

""Scotland's quiet majority had their say last year.

""And we will honour their decision, build on it, and move our country forward together – irrespective of the obstacles put in our path.

""We have the leadership, we have the grit and we have the confidence to take on this fight.

""Have confidence in our future

""Have confidence in our country.

""And get out there and win.""",,status,,2015-04-20 09:20:18,105,25,6,105,0,0,0,0,0

By Ruth Davidson (The Evening Times - 08/04/2015)

ON Monday, many of us had reason to celebrate.

Not only was it a Bank Holiday - and sunny one too - it was also Tartan Day on the other side of the Atlantic.

But just as importantly, and you might have to bear with me here, Monday marked the beginning of the first full week of the new financial year.

Granted, this doesn't normally set pulses racing - but thanks to the decisions taken by the UK Government, this year maybe it should.

Because Monday was the date when changes to the tax system came into force.

Once again - as has been the case in each and every year since the UK Government came to power - there has been an increase in the amount of money you can earn before you start paying income tax.

Today, the Personal Allowance stands at £10,600 and, as the Prime Minister has stated, a future Conservative government was go even further and raise the threshold to £12,500 - almost double the rate we inherited five years ago.

What this means, is that more money now stays in the pockets of those who earn it.

In all, over 2.32 million Scots have seen their taxes cut by this UK Government and it is those on the lowest incomes that have benefited most.

Indeed, thanks to the increases in the Personal Allowance we have lifted 261,000 people out of tax altogether and reduced the average tax bill by £825.

How this contrasts with the system we inherited from Labour; a system where it didn't pay to work and that took too big a slice of hard-earned wages.

Rather than go back to that approach - the bad old days of financial mismanagement and economic decline - my party wants to build on the achievements of the last five years and further strengthen our economy.

I am proud of the fact that under this government employment in Scotland is up by 174,000 and that there are now 56,700 fewer people claiming benefits.

That we have scrapped fuel duty rises - saving motorists an average of £9 each and every time they go to the pumps.

And that we have protected pensioner incomes by maintaining the triple lock, ensuring that the state pension goes up by whichever is higher - inflation, wages or 2.5%.

This is our record; achievements that have made a real and lasting difference to people's lives.

Thanks to the tough choices taken by the UK Government, the deficit is down, a record number of people are in work and we have the fastest growing major economy in the world.

None of this happened by chance and, in just over four weeks, we mustn't put it in jeopardy by handing Ed Miliband the keys to Downing Street - allowing the very people that crashed the car to get back behind the wheel.",,status,,2015-04-08 10:50:05,135,44,14,135,0,0,0,0,0

242829922425897_870912912950925,"I've written in the Edinburgh Evening News today on the choice we face at the General Election. Here's the full article:

By Ruth Davidson (Edinburgh Evening News - 07/04/2015)

Last year the city of Edinburgh voted resoundingly to keep Scotland within the strength and security of the United Kingdom.

It did so emphatically – with 61 per cent rejecting the SNP's plans to separate Scotland from the rest of Britain.

It means Edinburgh was Scotland's city most intent on rejecting independence – more than Glasgow, Dundee and Aberdeen.

However, come May 7, not even a year on from that definitive verdict, it could all be jeopardised again.

The same Capital residents who backed the union in September will be asked to return to the ballot box for the closest election in decades.

We all know what a vote for the SNP achieves; the party has made clear it will agitate and agitate for separation, and if Nicola Sturgeon cannot do it here, Alex Salmond will do it in Westminster.

The party couldn't persuade Scots of the case for separation, so instead it has made a series of threats to Westminster, unashamedly admitting it would even seek to bring a Conservative government down.

However, a vote for Labour will achieve exactly the same thing.

There is no way Ed Miliband will be able to wriggle his way into 10 Downing Street without Alex Salmond's assistance.

At this point, the former First Minister would be able to make no end of demands on the weak Prime Minister he is propping up.

And we know what those demands will be. He'll make Ed Miliband agree to full fiscal autonomy, something that would have almost as disastrous an impact on Scotland's finances as separation. He'll make Ed Miliband weaken our defence, costing thousands of jobs and destabilising the entire UK's defence deterrent.

And he'll make Ed Miliband commit to even more borrowing, ruining all the economic progress that has been made under the Conservatives in the last five years.

Who knows what else he'd ask for – possibly even another referendum immediately.

People in England are waking up to this threat, but it is voters in Edinburgh who can help counter it. We know the Liberal Democrats are dead in the water, with the party polling as low as a staggering two per cent.

Statistics out this week have also suggested 85 per cent of their voters have deserted them since 2010.

All that means the only party who can stand up for Scotland's place in the UK, who can help guarantee that economic recovery continues against a stable constitutional background, are the Scottish Conservatives.

We have a tremendous group of candidates across Edinburgh.

Iain McGill in Edinburgh North and Leith is one of the most admired activists in Scotland, from his work with homeless charities to his tireless commitment to the area.

And in Gordon Lindhurst (Edinburgh South West), James McMordie (Edinburgh East), Miles Briggs (Edinburgh South) and Lindsay Paterson (Edinburgh West) we have people ready to step up to the plate and serve Edinburgh with Conservative policies at the centre of their agenda.

It is a clear choice for Edinburgh voters; an SNP intent on breaking up Britain, a Labour party who are running away from their role in Better Together, or the Scottish Conservatives who will proudly back the views of the 61 per cent who said No.

Edinburgh made its feelings clear on the UK in September – only a vote for the Scottish Conservatives will honour those views on May 7.",,status,,2015-04-07 09:15:31,142,45,8,142,0,0,0,0,0

242829922425897_867989943243222,"Delighted to speak to the Scottish Police Federation conference today. You can read my speech below:

""Good morning everyone and can I thank the Scottish Police Federation for inviting me here today.

May I start simply by offering my own gratitude to you again for the work you have done in the last year.

Your hard work means Scotland is a safer place. I know you don't like measuring yourself in numbers but people feel safer and know they are safer when we hear that violent offences such as robbery, sexual assault and murder are happening less often in our streets.

People feel safer and they know are safer when they see detection rates are up and that a higher proportion of criminals are now being caught.

That stands testament to the expertise and professionalism shown by officers across the country – in what I know are difficult circumstances – and we thank you for it.

And as Brian mentioned in his speech, I would also like to take this chance to thank the police for one particular incident – your response to the bin lorry tragedy in Glasgow at Christmas.

I witnessed at first hand the quiet, calm authority exuded by the police in the wake of that terrible day.

It shows that the police are not just here to protect society, but to keep society going when the worst happens.

And it is a reminder to politicians –and one Brian is right to raise – that policing can never be measured in a spread sheet.

I too hear police officers telling me of their frustration with the various statistical hoops that they are forced to jump through every day.

We all should accept that policing – like all public services – only succeeds because officers are prepared to go the extra mile, to put in the extra shift.

It isn't measurable, but we do know that it is priceless.

Now as Brian mentioned, there is a general election coming along very soon and in his speech he also raised many of the issues that I know are of concern to ordinary policemen and women across Scotland.

I'd like to try and address them if I can.

I'd also like to take the opportunity to set out some of the Conservative priorities on law and order as we approach not just this election but one at Holyrood next year too.

Brian has already brought the elephant of funding into the room so let me confront this right away.

The Conservative plan at this election is clear. We want to get Britain back into the black so that we are no longer adding to the debts we already have which our grandchildren will have to pay off.

I see no sense in a short-term funding plan which means we are only spending billions extra in debt interest by the end of the next parliament.

So we have set out how that will require another £30bn of savings.

The Chancellor has set out how we plan to do that. It's a mixture of savings to the welfare budget, departmental budgets and a crackdown on tax avoidance.

On the latter point, let me say I agree entirely with your chairman – in answer to his question, it can't be right, and it isn't right, that aggressive tax avoidance is tolerated in tough financial times.

I'm glad to say that this Coalition Government has cracked down on it more than the previous Labour administration, and I know this will be a priority in the next five years too.

But, yes, our judgement is that we will need to make further savings on top of that. That's our choice – we need to continue down this path in order to get the country back into financial health so that the long term future of our public services is assured.

The fact is that our UK debt interest payments next year are an astonishing 46 times the annual police budget in Scotland – that's why we need to get the deficit down so we're not paying almost 50 times what we pay on police in Scotland to foreign lenders and the international money markets

I know the views of police officers here about the impact of that and I know that platitudes about doing more with less aren't going to cut it.

There is a responsibility on those of us backing this path to come up with some fresh ideas.

For my part, in the last few weeks, I have set up an Independent Commission of some of Scotland's leading public funding experts to examine Scotland's system of public funding and to see how bets we fund our services.

That is all the more important as we prepare to take on new tax powers at the Scottish Parliament which will vastly reduce the block grant element of our funding package.

The Commission will report back next year.

For the time being, I simply state that a Scottish Government which can afford free tuition fees, free prescriptions, and free bus passes for people who haven't yet reached retirement age, are clearly demonstrating that funding decisions are a choice of priority, not necessity.

I won't offer false promises at this election. I will offer my pledge to do all I can to provide the ideas and the input that ensures public money is spent where it should be: on the beat, on the street, and ensuring that criminals know there is no hiding place for them in Scotland.

It was the Scottish Conservatives who, a few years back, persuaded the SNP government to increase the numbers of police in Scotland by 1,000 as a deal for backing their budget.

And it will be Scottish Conservatives who, over the next few years, will always put law and order first.

Now I couldn't also make this speech without mentioning stop and search.

Following the publication of details showing the number of children being stopped and searched, I was among the politicians who raised a red flag.

At the time, it simply didn't seem right to me for a senior force commander to walk into the Scottish Parliament, tell MSPs that a policy such as the consensual stop and search of children was – in his words – indefensible…

….tell Parliament that such a practice would cease and would no longer happen.

…only for us to discover, many months later, that this so-called indefensible practice had continued.

It also raised a wider question about police accountability at a time when people are still getting used to the new single police force.

Now it isn't for politicians like me to order the police around. Indeed, one of our original concerns about the new single force was that a powerful government in Edinburgh could have undue influence over it.

My concerns, highlighted by the stop and search row, focussed on whether we have the right balance of a powerful single police force with operational freedom, and an oversight body with clout.

It also raised issues of the accuracy of records and whether there was a disconnect between senior offices such as Assistant Chief Constables publicly detailing a change of policy and rank and file officers charged with carrying it out.

We are reviewing as a party whether the single police force model brought in needs refinement.

We need to decide whether the problems we have seen in the last few weeks are teething problems or an indication of something more serious.

In the meantime, I was glad to see yesterday's report by HM Inspectorate of Constabulary calling for a new code of practice to govern stop-and-search.

And can I just repeat my support for your Chairman's point: policing for statistics instead of policing for the public is a ludicrous situation. Speaking to police officers, I know this is one of their common complaints.

I accept that politicians often don't help end this absurdity.

We are a small country with good communication networks and I am sure we can get this right.

If that replies in some measure to the chairman, I hope I may offer some thoughts of my own ahead of the next two elections as to how we improve our law and order system more.

As I mentioned at the beginning, it is encouraging to see violent crime statistics going in the right direction.

But we still see far too many examples of times where the good work of police in cracking down on crime is let down by a justice system which seems to favour the criminal over the victim.

So I want reforms in three areas.

We want to scrap automatic early release. In February, I welcomed moves by Nicola Sturgeon to end this practice for all long term prisoners. But the truth is that, as this only applies to people serving a sentence of 4 years or more, 97% of criminals aren't covered.

Yes, it was a previous Conservative government which introduced automatic early release. It wasn't the right call and I want it changed. Nobody understands why a judge's sentence should be immediately slashed the moment a criminal is sent down. It is eroding faith in justice and it needs to stop.

Secondly, I want to see effective whole life orders reintroduced. The European Court of Human Rights has confirmed that the UK has the right to put some offenders behind bars for the rest of their lives. Frankly, there are some crimes that deserve it – and for me, the murder of a police officer is one.

Justice systems sometimes need to send out a signal – and at a time when assaults on police officers are rising to worrying levels, this is one we need to do.

And thirdly, we need to toughen up community sentences. Far too many Community Payback Orders are currently being flouted or ignored.

So we've proposed a simple reform, already used in America: breach a community order and you should spend 24 to 48 hours in jail. It's swift, simple justice and evidence from around the world shows it works.

Taken together, that plan will – I believe – back up the police on the front line and send the right messages to society that crime really doesn't pay.

We must tilt the balance back in favour of the victim and the law-abiding citizen. And I simply don't accept we have that balance right now.

I don't pretend that the Conservatives at this election are proposing the passage of least resistance.

I do claim, however, that we have a plan for the long-term – a plan which will lock in a better future for Scotland and the United Kingdom.

And I do claim that we are want to see the return of a justice system which comes down hard on those who break the law.

It remains for me to thank you once again for hosting this event for the four of us here today.

And I look forward to any questions you have for me later.

Thank you.""",,status,,2015-04-01 06:31:07,72,4,7,72,0,0,0,0,0

I have to say still feels a long, long way away to May 7th right now.

This is going to be a marathon, not a sprint.

For politicians it's going to be a test of stamina.

For the general public it's going to be a test of patience.

But at least what it does mean is that all the political parties standing in this campaign have the chance to set out their stall.

So, this morning, I want to talk to you not so much about what we're going to do – there's plenty of time for that.

I want to talk to you about what Conservatives in government have done…what we've achieved, and how it has made a difference.

Because we all know what's coming.

There's going to be a line spun by our opponents in this election. The one we Scottish Conservatives are well used to.

….that in office the Conservatives only look after their own

….that we only use power to help those with power

…that, in short, our motives and our actions are somehow less noble, less moral than those paragons of virtue in Labour and the SNP. That we are something different, something less, something 'other' – that our belief in the power of ideas, in politics itself has less to do with service than preferment or advancement.

And it is utter nonsense.

So, I'm going to take the fight to our opponents in this campaign.

I'm not prepared to see our record trashed by half truths and lazy assertion.

Let's not take lectures from the SNP and Labour on how we improve the lives of millions.

Let's not hear any earnest lessons about economic competence from Ed Miliband, the man who forgot to include the deficit in his own conference speech.

And let's absolutely refuse to take lectures on social justice from politicians on six figure book deals quaffing pink champagne.

Let's tell people about our record. Let's make sure they know.

I want you all here to be in no doubt and to make sure people out there are are left in no doubt too…

I'm in this party because I believe it looks out for the little guy, the outsider, the family that just wants a fair deal.

And I want people to know…

…that we Conservatives are in this to look out for all of society.

…that our record in government stands true to that aim.

…and that it is the job destroying plans being set out by an SNP Labour alliance on the left which threatens to ruin all that hard work.

So here's how we take on our critics. We give them with facts.

You'll see three big numbers behind me. I want you to remember them during this campaign.

174,000. That's the number of jobs created in Scotland alone since we got Labour out of office and got a competent Conservative-led Government back behind the wheel.

56,700. The number of jobseekers in Scotland who have come off benefits since we got Labour out of government.

And 37,600. The number of new businesses created in Scotland since that infamous Labour Minister walked out of his Whitehall office back in 2010 leaving a note to say there was no money left.

Labour's idea of a joke. Deadly serious for the rest of us.

But at least it spelled out the situation the government faced back then. We were facing a national crisis.

The coalition was formed because it had to be – anything else wouldn't have given the security this country needed.

We all know how tough it has been for families since then. The government had to take decisions which were difficult for people. Sometimes very difficult.

But when it came to getting the books under control, under a Conservative chancellor, the top 20% have contributed more to deficit reduction that the other 80% combined.

And it's in those numbers that we are beginning to see a path back.

We now have the highest employment we've ever seen in this country. The highest ever.

More jobs being created in Britain than the rest of Europe combined – it's no wonder immigration is still rising – if you're French or Spanish, where else would you want to go?

All those new businesses – remember those siren warnings back in 2010 about public sector job cuts?

It turns out that for every public sector lost since then, our amazing businesses have produced another three.

And with jobs on the rise, and a welfare system that finally is beginning to incentivise work, we see more people in Scotland off jobseekers as could fit into Hampden park.

Now I know what our critics say at this point.

They might be jobs, but they're the wrong type of jobs.

It might be a recovery, but people don't feel it.

Now, I agree – absolutely agree – that there's an awful lot more we can do.

If a firm is using zero hours contracts to exploit their workers, then I say let's stop them – and by the way, the UK government is.

If a small business is paying less than the living wage, then I say let's help them to pay more – and a Scottish Conservative plan has laid out how.

But let's just stop for a minute and ask whether our critics in the SNP and Labour are right about it all.

And let's hit them with a few more facts.

The minimum wage – we've raised it by 3%, ahead of inflation, and I can tell you, our Prime Minister wants to raise it more.

Taking the low paid out of tax- a total of 261,000 people in Scotland have been taken out of paying tax altogether, meaning that if you're on the minimum wage, you're now £618 a year better off.

And on the cost of living, the independent Office of Budget Responsibility now says that household incomes will be higher in real terms than when we came to government. And thanks to falling inflation, that pound in your pocket is going to go further still.

As to inequality, I agree there is a disconnect between the mega rich who seem to float above society out of the reach of the rest of us.

But do you know what? It's a fact that the top 1% will soon start paying 27% of all tax, up from 25% now – higher than in any year of the last Labour government.

And it's a fact that this Conservative treasury has finally started doing what Labour failed utterly to do, cracking down on aggressive tax avoidance so that everyone pays their share.

I could go on. Fuel duty frozen – again – which means we're limiting the cost of filling up a tank as best we can.

One million Scottish pensioners have benefitted from the triple lock protecting their state pension. It means the average Scot on the full state pension is now £560 better off. And has reduced pensioner poverty to its lowest ever level.

Funding for our NHS protected right across the last five years, and passed on – in full – to the Scottish Government.

And one thing we don't make enough about: we're part of a government which, from its office down the road from here in East Kilbride, has protected our aid budget to the poorest nations of the world, and kept our commitment to the world's poorest people.

I know that people are still finding it tough. And if we want to get our debts finally falling, I know, too, that more savings will have to be made.

That's not going to be easy.

But the gains we've made are real. And they give me confidence to know we can do more.

Raising the rate at which people start paying tax.

Keeping the retired secure in their old age.

All part of a country that, once again, lives within its means and doesn't pile its debts onto the shoulders of our grandchildren.

Conservatives didn't take the tough decisions of the last few years out of some ideological addiction to a smaller state.

We did it because we believe in a different path to social justice than those who oppose those cuts.

One which puts the long term ahead of short term tactics. Which knows that if we cut our cloth now, we'll all benefit tomorrow.

It means that, while there's six long weeks to go, the choice is already very clear.

All I see from Labour, the SNP and the LibDems is weakness and division.

A desire to dodge reality and either ignore the hard choices, or pretend they can be wished away.

And the terrifying prospect that not just one of these parties might get their hands on power, but that they might be grappling with the controls all together, and all at the same time.

You know, I don't know what's happened to the once proud Labour and LibDem parties.

All we see now are headless chickens.

Still running around the chicken coop, not a brain cell is sight…and about to get stuffed.

I don't think Scots deserve to get dragged into their mess.

Labour, the SNP and the LibDems simply aren't prepared for responsible government which keeps the recovery on track. Their plans are unfit for our country's needs – And it's our job to make sure they don't get to use them.

And we do it by making sure we show up the positives of the other side of that choice. The Scottish Conservative choice.

Not the party of the establishment, as our critics like to call it.

But the party that takes on the establishment – the old Scottish Labour establishment, the centralising SNP establishment, the lazy, complacent central belt establishment that still thinks it knows best across Scotland but which is holding us back.

…the party that demands a great school for every child, and won't accept that it's ok for some schools to coast.

…the party that thinks money should stay with the worker, the grafter, not to feather the nest of a growing bureaucracy.

…the party which won't accept a centralising SNP government that just wants to hoard power, not to give it away.

We're the party which stands up for the moderate centre ground, the party that's on your side, the party with the common good at its heart.

So tell people boldly and confidently in this campaign…

We're the party that put the backbone into last years' referendum victory.

We're the party that has given Scotland the best of both worlds: strong devolution in a strong United Kingdom.

We're the party that has secured our economy and is bringing the country back into the black.

We're the party that will help low paid workers keep more of their money, delivering better paid jobs for all.

Come on, we're not going to let Ed Miliband become Prime Minister, are we?

We're not going to let Labour and the SNP throw away all the gains we've made over the last five years, are we?

But here's what we are going to do.

We're going to take our record of achievement to doorsteps across Scotland.

A growing economy, more jobs, the deficit being cut, work always paying more than benefits, living standards on the way up, poverty on the way down.

We're going to take that record of achievement – and our plans for the future – to the Scottish people and we're going to ask them to choose.

Do we go forward or back?

Back to the days of mismanagement and decline?

Back to uncertainty and insecurity?

Or forward with the Conservatives to more opportunity, greater prosperity and a better future for everyone?

Let's hear it for a great campaign

For spreading our message, telling our story, speaking our truth.

And on May 7th, let's hear it for a Conservative victory

Thank You.""",,status,,2015-03-30 06:29:49,152,29,16,152,0,0,0,0,0
242829922425897_865630026812547,"I've written in The Courier today:

1. ""I know it's unfashionable to say it, but I love general election time.

As a fully paid up political geek, there's the fascination of watching the the ebb and flow of the campaign trail.

And, as a politician, it's refreshing to get out of the political bubble at Holyrood and speak to people.

That's particularly so right now. Because it's clear that there is a remarkable degree of political engagement across Scotland right now.

A poll this week found that 62% of Scots regarded themselves as interested in politics, compared to just 49% South of the Border.

The reason is obvious: last year's independence referendum involved just about everybody in the country and has shaken up the old political order.

The old assumptions have been shattered. Politics is interesting again.

We all know what the polls are currently suggesting. It looks like people are deserting Labour and the LibDems in their droves.

And the SNP is holding onto much of the support it won in the 2011 Holyrood election when it won a majority at the Scottish Parliament.

If those polls are right, the SNP could end up with many more seats than it gained in the last general election.

Certainly, that's what Alex Salmond thinks – on his book tour, I see he has already put those seats in his back pocket and is now already planning how 'he' intends to run Westminster.

To hear him speak, it sounds very much like Alex is taking people for granted. The SNP is in danger of getting ahead of itself.

So before the campaign begins, it's not a bad idea to ask a simple question: what are we actually being asked to do here?

At its simplest, we're electing an MP to serve in the House of Commons. And we're electing a new government of the United Kingdom.

That government will then be faced with some massive decisions: about bringing down the yawning budget deficit this country still runs, reducing the debts that we're passing onto our children and grandchildren, and – at the same time – ensuring we grow the economy to help fund our NHS and good quality public services.

It's also a plain fact is that one of two people will be in charge of those decisions after the election: it will either be David Cameron or Ed Miliband.

I know which one the SNP is supporting: Mr Salmond and Nicola Sturgeon have already said they will put Mr Miliband in power, and try and extract concessions from him to suit their own Nationalist vision.

So it's Conservatives on one side, and the SNP and Labour on the other.

In my view, if you have a mortgage, if you have credit cards, or if you're hoping to benefit from a secure economic recovery, a weak and chaotic SNP-Labour pact is not one to back.

It would lead to insecurity, not just for your job and the economy, but also for the future of the country at large.

The SNP is still pushing for independence, and any deal they do in this election will be done with the express purpose of pushing that agenda along.

I know many people still support that independence option and while I disagree with it, I respect it.

But I back Scotland in the UK. And if you want security – for the economy and for Britain –  the only option is the Scottish Conservatives.

I know times haven't always been easy under this Coalition Government. But we've weathered the storm and – unlike some other countries who are still struggling – we're coming through the other side.

For all those people who are so engaged with politics, or fed up with the Westminster establishment, I realise this 'steady-as-she-goes' plan isn't perhaps the flashiest of offers out there.

But it is the choice we face. Undoing all of the hard work over the past five years or going that final few yards to get us out of the red and into the black for good.

This election isn't about having a free kick at the old guard. It's about deciding who runs one of the greatest nations on earth.

At the end of the day, that's what we're being asked to decide this May.

 

 

2. ""Not a single vote has been cast for the General Election yet, but I see Alex Salmond is already sampling a taste of the Westminster high-life.

The ex-First Minister – who is quitting the Scottish Parliament so he can go back to London –  was interviewed by the New Statesman magazine last week at a posh London hotel.

The journalist who met him for lunch began his piece: ""As we settle down at a table, Salmond orders a bottle of pink champagne.""

Now I like a funny-coloured drink as much as the next girl – but not for lunch, not on someone else's bill and certainly not in the Holyrood canteen where I eat.  Such extravagance probably explains why Mr Salmond is so keen to get back to London's fine dining eateries.

While I'm not averse to some fizz at a wedding or special occasion, I'm more of a whisky lover myself – nothing beats a glass of Highland Park.

Which is why I was toasting George Osborne last week when he announced a historic cut in the rate of duty on whisky.

This will mean that our distillers across Scotland get a much-needed boost as they export their wares across the UK and beyond. It might not take much off the price of a nip, but it is invaluable to distillers and makes a huge difference in protecting Scottish jobs.

I took a bottle of Scottish Parliament Speyside Malt down to London earlier this week and gave it to George as a thank-you.

We didn't get round to a glass of pink champers – we'll leave that to London jet-setters like Mr Salmond.

 

 

 

3. ""I've argued for years that the video games sector should be able to compete more fairly on the world stage.

In fact, I made a whole documentary on the subject as a journalist, before I became an MSP.

We really are renowned for our computer games in Scotland, particularly in the Dundee area.

It's great to hear that the industry is flourishing with new studios, growing numbers of employees, greater investment and growing revenues.

And it's this upward industry which supports hundreds of talented people including artists, engineers, graphic designers, mathematicians, physicists and musicians.

That's why I was delighted last week to see the Chancellor announce £4 million to a new Video Games Prototype Fund, over the next four years.

The cash will aid access to finance and business support – targeting both present and future games development talent.

It will also give enthusiastic start-up firms a step-up and encourage them to develop new games ideas.

With around 250 new jobs to be created, it's sure to be a massive boost to the Scottish economy.

The announcement will see the development of a new fund open to applications to take forward essential skills and talent programmes running to 2019.

This long-term additional measure will help safeguard our gaming industry.

The video games market offers high growth opportunity within the UK – it already contributes more than £99 million.

This can only be a good thing, showcasing Scotland's talent with the UK and abroad.

It goes without saying that the Chancellor's announcement will certainly help fuel further success.""",,status,,2015-03-27 10:59:49,139,26,15,139,0,0,0,0,0

242829922425897_863922840316599,"My article in today's London Evening Standard: 

""For two people whose life mission is to make London the capital of a foreign country, Alex Salmond and Nicola Sturgeon seem to have set up shop here in recent weeks.

Having failed to convince Scots of their plan for separation, they're now trying to convince England that it's inevitable and – despite the recent referendum result to the contrary – that Scotland now is a different country regardless.

Go on chaps, they urge, Scotland has one foot out the door already, why not just sign the divorce papers quietly and get it over with. It's a clever trick, but don't be fooled. I'm also in London today (Tuesday) to attend the last political meeting before the election. And I want to set out a simple truth: the SNP is not Scotland and Scotland is not the SNP.

When Alex Salmond talks of planning to hold a weak Ed Miliband government to ransom as he did on the Sunday TV sofas that doesn't just scare people south of the border, it scares many, many Scots too. He is simply doing what nationalists have done the world over – attempting to conflate the national interest with his own narrow, ideological one and paint anyone who disagrees as unpatriotic.

It's cheap, dirty politics designed to send out the message that everyone north of the border is equally Scottish, but some are more Scottish than others.

The majority of people in Scotland want no truck with this version of divide-and-rule. While Alex Salmond may have told the Marr show on Sunday that whoever holds the balance, holds the power – and gloated over votes that have yet to be cast – he would do well to remember that nationalism is still (and has always been) a minority pursuit in Scotland.

The real Scotland – not the oft quoted ""progressive consensus"" which demands a Nordic way of doing things – is the Scotland that voted No to independence by a clear margin last September. A firm decision made despite three years of relentless campaigning by an SNP government with the Scottish Civil Service at its disposal.

The real Scotland is the one which repeated social attitude surveys show holds similar views to the rest of the UK on difficult issues such as immigration, capping benefits, and holding a referendum on EU membership.

The real Scotland is the one where two thirds of people think the British economy is doing well and will continue to do well for their family over the next year – confirmed by a recent Ashcroft poll of more than 5,000 Scots.

The real Scotland is the one that wishes Alex Salmond and Nicola Sturgeon would stop the endless shuttle visits to London to talk up divisions within the UK and actually get back to dealing with the things they're paid to address – like sorting out our schools and hospitals.

There's a reason that people in London and elsewhere in the British Isles bridle when senior SNP members are interviewed on television. It's because – having failed to sufficiently stoke division in Scotland for separation – nationalists endeavour to annoy the rest of the country into pushing Scotland towards the exit themselves. So the next time you see the SNP preaching about how different Scotland is – think of it as the away fans singing at a football ground.

Yes, they're noisy. Yes, their chanting can really wind you up. But they are in the minority. The real Scotland contains a home support of far greater number, and is opposed to their separation plans. A home support that wants what it voted for in the referendum – to be an equal partner in the UK with more decisions taken closer to home. It's what the majority of people in London want, too.""
