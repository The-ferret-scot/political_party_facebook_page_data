Here's a run-down of the Scottish Parliament 2016 Holyrood election in numbers:

At over a million, the SNP polled a record number of constituency votes – 1,059,897 to be precise. No party has ever done this before. The previous highest number was 908,392, polled by Labour in 1999.

In fact, the SNP polled more than Labour and the Tories put together. Collectively they polled 1,016,105 votes.

The SNP has won 59 constituency seats, surpassing the previous record of 53 seats, achieved by Labour in 1999, as well as the SNP in 2011.

The SNP has polled 46.5 per cent in the constituency vote, up from 45.4 per cent in 2011. This is higher than the previous record.

The SNP won a clean sweep of six out of Scotland's seven cities: Glasgow, Dundee, Aberdeen, Inverness, Stirling and Perth.

The Liberal Democrats made no progress. They won the same number of seats and their constituency vote is down to its lowest level since devolution.

This is the lowest Labour vote in Scotland since the First World War, and the last time they finished third was 1910.",Scottish National Party (SNP),link,http://www.snp.org/_sp16_in_numbers,2016-05-06 10:38:17,1120,73,0,1022,90,6,1,0,1
