The waiting time for Elaine Hanby's cataract operation is shocking.

When the government target is 12 weeks for a consultation, a wait of 12 months is completely unacceptable.

And it is astounding that Mrs Hanby is being forced to consider going to Europe for treatment because she cannot get seen in her local hospital in Inverness.

Labour MSPs are dealing with cases from Caithness to Paisley, from Dumbarton to Aberdeen. We shouldn't have to bring every case to parliament for something to happen.

Earlier this year I met with consultants and surgeons at the Aberdeen Royal Infirmary. They told me that a new trauma centre could be the difference between life and death for people in the North East. Whether it's someone in a serious car crash or an accident on the oil rigs, having access to world class trauma care could be a life saver. The SNP's three year delay could cost lives. 

Patients were promised world class care at the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital, but they just aren't getting it. People in the North East were promised new trauma centres, but they are years behind schedule. The SNP promised to abolish delayed discharge, but since then almost 700 people died waiting to leave hospital. 

Nicola Sturgeon used to crusade against injustice, but now she pats herself on the back because the Red Cross hasn't yet declared Scotland's NHS a humanitarian crisis.

Targets are being missed and dedicated health service staff are telling us they are under pressure like never before.

Yet they will not be able to bring their cases to the Scottish Child Abuse Inquiry because they were not in care when they were abused. This is true for all those who suffered abuse in youth groups, parishes or other sports clubs.

Survivors groups have asked that the inquiry's remit be extended to all situations where a duty of care existed. Scottish Labour has backed that call.

Missed targets, lower growth and higher borrowing â that's the record after six years of Tory government. The Tories' reckless pursuit of a hard Brexit will only make things worse in the years to come.

This Autumn Statement was more of the same old Tory mantra - cut, cut and cut again. The Chancellor could have announced an end to the austerity which is damaging our public services and holding back working families. He could also have announced major new investment in the North Sea oil and gas industry to protect jobs and the local economy.

Yet Philip Hammond did none of these things. The same cuts to public spending remain in place, which will put at risk the chances of people who just want to get on in life. The reduction in the taper rate for Universal Credit will only return a fraction of what has been taken from working families. And the Chancellor's failure to reverse cuts to ESA leave disabled people worse off at a time when what they really need is support from government.

City Deals for Stirling and Edinburgh are welcome steps. It is vital that both the UK and Scottish governments get on with delivering both deals without delay.

The new powers of the Scottish Parliament mean we don't need to implement Tory tax choices. Scottish Labour opposes the increase in the higher rate tax threshold at a time when spending on public services like schools and hospitals is being cut. It's the wrong priority at the wrong time. Scottish Labour has repeatedly called for a 50p top rate of tax on the richest few earning more than Â£150,000 a year, so we can invest in education. That's the right choice for Scotland.

When the Scottish budget is published next month SNP ministers must not simply pass on these Tory cuts. The Scottish Parliament has the powers to make different choices from the Tories.

We can't tackle poverty and give every young person a fair chance in life by cutting public services. It cannot be right that in 2016 a child's chance of getting on in life is still determined by how much money their parents have, rather than by their ability and work rate.

Donald Trump's behaviour towards women sends a dangerous signal across the world. In January, we will have a misogynist in the White House.

But Scotland is not free from intolerance. In Scotland the EIS has revealed the unacceptable level of bullying in our schools and 42 per cent of teaching staff have witnessed homophobia and transphobia.

We have seen reports of hate crimes against disabled people soar by more than 300 per cent since 2010 and cases of Islamaphobia have nearly doubled.

The events of this week are distressing for those of us who believe in a society that is stronger together; who believe that we get more done working together than we do standing apart; who believe that what unites us is far greater than what divides us.

The SNP made a manifesto commitment in 2007 to 'scrap the unfair council tax'.

Nearly ten years on, Nicola Sturgeon has not kept that promise.

The SNP now wants to just 'tinker with the bands' â something Nicola Sturgeon admitted 'would not make the system any fairer'. 

That isn't big enough or bold enough.

Under the SNP's plan, families living in homes worth the least will be as worse off as they are today.

But under Labour's plans, families in band A properties would pay less than they do today.

New independent research shows that under the SNP's plans, someone in Band A will still pay four times more tax as a proportion of the value of their home than the richest in Band H.

Labour would scrap the unfair council tax and introduce a fairer system so that 80 per cent of households would be better off. The SNP should keep its promise and support Labour's proposal to introduce a fairer system.",First Minister's Questions - Scottish Parliament: 3rd November 2016,video,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYnl8z6hmPA,2016-11-03 11:49:57,78,18,15,76,0,0,1,0,1

New independent analysis shows that the number of elderly Scots getting any care at all has fallen by 12 per cent.

This is the difference that having Labour politicians in Government can make.

1595489564062253_1766541750290366,"#ICYMI - My weekly Daily Record column yesterday on the Rio Olympics and drug cheats, read it here:  

THIS week the world's greatest sporting event kicks off in Rio. How can you not be excited about the Olympics in one of the world's greatest cities?

For a few weeks every four years, people all across the world get obsessed by sports they would never watch at any other time.

All of a sudden we become experts on the finer points of archery, keirin and gymnastics.

Yes, some of us will forget all about them within a week of the Olympics finishing, but for others these moments become the inspiration to become the next generation of British athletes.

I can still remember like it was yesterday, 'Super Saturday' from the London Games, when Mo Farah, Jess Ennis and Greg Rutherford won gold medals on the same day.

Magical moments in time are created, offering young people all over the world an example of what hard work can achieve.

Yet a cloud has been cast over this year's Olympic Games in Rio in the form of the Russian doping scandal.

The World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) issued a damning verdict on Russia's attempts to give their athletes an unfair advantage.

Not only were Russian athletes found to be doping, WADA concluded that it was state-sponsored â meaning the Russian government co-ordinated the cheating.

The anti-doping agency recommended banning all Russian athletes from the Olympics this year, but the governing body rejected that conclusion.

That's disappointing. Of course some innocent athletes would be unfairly punished, but until the authorities send a strong signal that they are serious about dealing with drug cheats some people will continue to take advantage.

Nothing goes against the spirit of the Olympics quite like drug cheats.

An event that should be about fair competition, hard work and natural ability has too often been marred by people who want to give themselves an artificial boost.

It ruins that inspiration, and taints ambition.

There is still a slim chance of the IOC stepping in and taking robust action before the Games kick off later in the week.

Judging by past performance I doubt it, though.

We cannot let the cheats win. They cannot be allowed to ruin what is for many the pinnacle of sport.

The achievements of heroes like Cathy Freeman, Michael Johnson and Sir Chris Hoy show the good side of sport.

We need all of our governing bodies to stand up to doping, for the good of everyone.",Kezia Dugdale: Nothing goes against Olympic spirit quite like drug cheats,link,http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/politics/kezia-dugdale-says-nothing-goes-8534135#8MCR0q1ClGwocA1d.97,2016-08-02 05:55:26,38,13,2,36,2,0,0,0,0

1595489564062253_1764358250508716,"READ My article for The Times: Clinton must offer hope to Americans

I'm in the office of Congressman Keith Ellison. He's standing for re-election in Minnesota's 5th district which immediately neighbours St. Paul, where Philando Castile was shot by a police officer earlier this month. The story reverberated around the world, amplified by the live-stream video of the aftermath by his girlfriend, and because it echoed a similar shooting the same week in Baton Rouge.

We're talking gun laws. He means that you can't empty multiple rounds of ammunition into an animal and still expect the meat to be fit for consumption, yet somehow the metaphor he uses seems to fit the wider political debate in America just now. You can't shoot the public discourse through with hyperbole and still expect the system to function.

A debate cast in extremes. Immigration, gun ownership. For or against, yes or no, black or white.

Black, Muslim and one of the first elected officials to back Bernie Sanders, Congressman Ellison tells me that a few miles from St Paul I'd find members of his family who own rifles for hunting, crucial for working the land. But he supports a ban on assault weapons. ""Useful in Fallujah,"" he says, but there's no place for them on the streets of Minneapolis.

The gun law reform debate is rife but poor. Everyone is so 'small c' conservative in their response. Tighter background checks, bans for people with mental health difficulties or a history of domestic abuse. No one seems brave enough to challenge the constitutional right to bear arms.

Why? I ask. The inner lawyer comes out and i am promptly and sharply reminded that the 2nd amendment doesn't detail a right to own a gun, that's just the Supreme Court's interpretation of it. So it could change, I ask. The eyes go down. Feet shuffle. If only someone was so brave.

Is it any wonder that after years of cautious, focus group and polled politics, people are screaming out for primary colours? The rise of both Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump speaks to a new language. Whilst they couldn't be more different in their outlook, the share a commonality - they are uncompromising. Don't like big banks? Shut them down. Don't like Mexicans? Build a wall.

I'm here on a cross party delegation to better understand how America's federalised system works. I've toured five states in three weeks, settling finally in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, where all hope of stopping Trump rests on the padded shoulders of Hillary Rodham Clinton at the Democratic National Convention.

But so far stopping Trump doesn't appear to be enough. There's a hunger for a vision and despondency about the presumptive Democratic nominee's ""trust"" problem. There's the scandal over Clinton's emails, where the former Secretary of State used a private server to apparently circumvent protocol in a bid to maintain her privacy. Then there's her experience, now successfully repackaged by her opponents as baggage and it's taking its toll. I've yet to meet anyone excited by her candidacy.

On my first day here in affectionately named Philly, I sit with coffee on the edge of City Hall and watch a band of marchers slowly gather. The city is staunchly Democratic. 85% of votes went Obama blue here in 2012. Clinton won her primary comfortably across the state, but what gathers is a large and growing band of Bernie Sanders Supporters. Thousands of them.

Placards read ""Still Bernie"", ""Bernie, maybe Jill but never Hill"" referencing the Green's candidate for President Jill Stein. Another sums up the mood of the March: ""Hillary: She'll say anything and change nothing.""

Is the political system here so broken, that it could see Trump win? A toxic combination of Republican rage combined with Democrat apathy? Surely not.

The trip has taken me from the steps of Capitol Hill in Washington DC to the foot of the Rocky Mountains and the edge of the Pacific Ocean in Southern California. Each speaks to the greatness, the expanse and the diversity of these United States. United often in their loathing of the federal government and the establishment that underpins it.

Coronado bridge arcs like a rainbow across San Diego bay. The height is easily explained by the fact that 60% of the U.S. Navy's Pacific fleet is based here and the bridge has to accommodate the height of the mightiest of warships. But why the boomerang bend out into the bay before it lands onshore? I'm reliably informed that federal government funding for major infrastructure projects like this can only be found if a bridge is beyond a certain length. They built the bridge out and in again at greater expense to make sure it was long enough to qualify for federal government cash.

You can laugh that off in the Yes, Minister fashion of just being tickled by government bureaucracy and wastefulness. But they're not laughing in Duluth, Minnesota. Here they've had five 1,000 year weather events in the last 15 years. The last, three years ago, ripped up streets and destroyed countless houses. Federal money was available to help clean up the damage, but it could only be spent restoring the streets to exactly how they were, not how they should be to prepare for future floods. Residents fear rain. The exasperation and frustration of those whose job it is to protect those communities at State level was palpable.

If lives were left at risk in the Mid-West, they were most likely lost because of the federal government shutdown back in June 2013. The failure to set a budget led to all government agencies locking their doors to employees for two weeks. It might have been three years ago but it's fresh and sore to Dr. Bob Sievers, who I meet at the University of Colorado where the Federal Agency for Disease Control is based. He's a scientist and inventor, with 30 patents to his name. He's invented a new type of dry aerosol for vaccinations and he's working on a plan to tackle measles in Asia. If his mission works, he'll save countless lives and millions of dollars as the need to refrigerate and dispose of glass needles will disappear. When the shutdown came he was locked out, tests were spoiled. He lost months and months of vital work.

This man is on the cusp of a global, life-saving discovery and the federal government just gets in the way. It's a far cry from the American Dream.

But that dream is still one that draws tens of thousands to the Mexican border each year. A nightmare to those Tea Party Republicans who chanted ""Build that wall"" in Cleveland, Ohio, at their own convention last week.

Everard Meade is the Director of the Trans Border Institute at the University San Diego. He's part immigration lawyer, part academic and speaks with a matter of factness that comes from fighting the system for 20 years. He tells me Mexican immigration is in decline, arrests at the border are at a 40 year low. And that wall idea? Not new. Bill Clinton's administration started it with Operation Gatekeeper back in 1994. 5.8miles of fence across urban centres and all it did was force those fleeing to take routes through the desert and hills, leading to increased loss of life.

Three quarters of those who made it, hundreds of thousands of people, are working and paying their taxes on fake social security numbers. Paying taxes but not drawing down on welfare benefits. Illegal immigration is propping up the whole system and the government are complicit and quids in. Mexican taxes are putting food into the mouths of America's poorest children, but no one is making that argument.

I meet a Pastor working in an immigration rights centre. He tells me that he had 100 refugees sleeping on the floor of his church. There's nowhere else for them to go. On the first night a couple of rednecks circled the church in an SUV making it clear they had rifles in the back. Intimidation and fear the mission. They only left when they discovered the refugees were Haitian rather than Mexican. They were here fleeing violence and destitution, not here to take ""your job.""

This is a country ill at ease and insecure and that makes it just like the rest of us. Globalisation is biting in America just as it is across the world, and the country's response is just the same. Reject reason and the facts, reach for those primary colours. 

Immigration, the economy, gun reform. In a Black and White America, the answers can only be found in the grey area of compromise, hard graft, understanding and drive. Only Clinton can do it, but she's only going to get the chance if she can muster a sense of hope on Thursday night when America tunes in to see her accept the Democratic nomination in Philadelphia.

Both the SNP and Tory Governments must take urgent action and adopt Labour's 'Brexit Action Plan"" to protect rights and support the economy now.
 
Labour and I support exploring all options to keep Scotland in the EU and the UK but the SNP must not take their eye off the day job â protecting jobs and the economy from the immediate impact of Brexit.
 
At a time when the Scottish economy is underperforming relative to the UK with growth revised downward, employment levels declining and worklessness increasing, the added impact of Brexit creates uncertainty for business. Independent economists indicate that it is likely that the Scottish and UK economy will fall in to recession this year.
 
We believe that the SNP must take urgent steps to address the immediate aftershocks to the Scottish economy following the EU referendum.
 
Our plan includes proposals such as:
 
- Bringing forward infrastructure spending with a particular focus on housebuilding with a target of 60,000 affordable homes built over the next 5 years.

- Establishing a Brexit Support Fund for at-risk sectors.

- Guaranteeing existing workers' rights in the UK.

- Confirming EU nationals studying, working and living in the UK can remain in the UK after Brexit.

- Ending austerity by using the new powers of the Scottish Parliament.
 
The consequences of the UK voting to leave the EU will be felt for years to come, and the only thing we know for sure is that we don't know very much about what the future holds.
 
Labour supports the SNP Government's efforts to secure Scotland's relationship with the EU.
 
The Tory and SNP Governments must explore all options to ensure that Scotland can remain in the EU and the UK. That is what the majority of people in Scotland voted for.
 
However, Scotland's Governments have a moral duty to protect jobs and the economy from the fallout of Brexit.
 
The Tory Government must stop using human beings as bargaining chips and guarantee that those who work, study and live here can stay and that the rights we enjoy at work are protected. At a time when Europe and the rest of the world are looking at the UK in confusion that would send a vital signal that we remain a compassionate country.

Speakers at the convention this week include presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, President Barack Obama and former President Bill Clinton.

In recent days I have been a member of a cross-party delegation to the United States, meeting with federal, state and local government officials to discuss issues including education, immigration, Brexit, the environment and trade. In meetings across the country officials have confirmed their fears that if Britain can vote for Brexit, the United States could vote for Donald Trump in November's presidential election. 

Seventeen million people across the UK, including more than one million in Scotland, rejected the views of the political establishment and backed Brexit. That must act as a warning to leaders all across the world, including Hillary Clinton.

We need to address their concerns and invest in their future, not write them all off.

1595489564062253_1761548474123027,"READ: Shipyard workers deserve an explanation on Type 26 delay 

This afternoon I wrote to the Defence Secretary Michael Fallon seeking a guarantee that all eight Type 26 Frigates will be built on the Clyde and I have also called for him to provide an honest explanation to shipyard workers and their families about why construction has been delayed.

You can read my full letter to Michael Fallon MP here: 

""Dear Michael

""During this week's evidence session on the Type 26 Global Combat Ship, the Ministry of Defence's chief executive for equipment told the Commons Defence Committee that no start date is set for the construction of the ships in the Clyde shipyards because the design process is only 60% complete.

""However, my understanding is that the design process is not the reason why no start date has been identified; rather, the design process has been slowed down because the start date has been delayed. In a separate letter to the Committee, the Ministry of Defence was unable to answer basic questions about commencement and completion dates. It also failed to answer questions about the impact on apprenticeships, when we know that the apprenticeship programme has already been reduced as a result of the Type 26 programme delay.

""The Ministry of Defence's equivocation and obfuscation in this matter is unacceptable. In November 2013, the Government announced that it would consolidate its warship capability in Glasgow and end shipbuilding in Portsmouth. A timeframe was set out and the Clyde shipyards made operational and staffing decisions based on that timeframe, which they expected the Government to honour. Under that timeframe, construction should have begun early next year. Now the Government is refusing to commit to any dates at all, and is being disingenuous about the reasons behind the delay, which I understand is in fact due to budget cuts.

""As leader of the Scottish Labour Party, I will continue to do everything possible to ensure the Government adheres to its previous commitments to the Clyde shipyards. However, the very least that they owe the workers and their families is an honest explanation as to why construction is being delayed.

""In a letter to the Leader of Glasgow City Council, Councillor Frank McAveety, on 28 June 2016, you wrote that ""Nothing has changed since the SDSR was announced last Novemberâ¦I can categorically state that all eight Type 26 ships will be built on the Clyde."" You further wrote that ""â¦in August 2014 we placed an order for three Offshore Patrol Vehicles (OPVs) to be built on the Clyde to provide continuity of shipbuilding work and so sustain capability and skills, ensuring the yard is ready to meet the complex challenge of Type 26.""

""In light of this, will you reconfirm to me in writing that all 8 Type 26 frigates will be built on the Clyde? Additionally, will you set out in writing the timetable for work to commence on building the Type 26, including the indicative dates for the completion of each ship? Contrary to what you said in your letter of 28 June, I have been told that the order for the three Offshore Patrol Vehicles will not be sufficient to sustain capability and skills in the yards, and any delay to the commencement of the Type 26 Frigates is likely to cause significant problems.

""The UK Government made a solemn commitment to workers on the Clyde that the Type 26 Frigates would be built according to a set timeframe, and the shipyards made plans in accordance with that commitment. Failure to honour that commitment would represent a breach of trust that would critically undermine the credibility of the UK Government and the new Prime Minister in the eyes of the people of Scotland. I hope you will take this into account in your response to the questions above.

""I look forward to hearing from you in due course.""

Read my column from Monday's Daily Record here:

It's not even been two weeks since the EU referendum and it feels like politics just hasn't stopped. 

Last Monday, in this newspaper, I said that we needed calm heads to take our country forward. It was a theme the Queen also used when she spoke at the opening of the Scottish Parliament on Saturday. 

I'm determined to keep cool for the decisions that lie ahead, but that doesn't mean I can't feel righteous anger at what now lies behind us. 

An anger that is fully aimed at Ruth Davidson and the Conservative Party for getting us into this situation - sorry this diabolical mess - in the first place. 

Why did we even have an EU referendum? Only to settle an age old score in the Tory party! 

They've always been divided on Europe. So in an attempt to shore himself up,  David Cameron took the ultimate gamble with our economy. Hundreds of thousands of jobs, the value of the pound, our rights at work all thrown onto a high stakes roulette wheel. And he lost. 

But it's not even the first time he's played fast and loose with our country's fortunes. 

Remember English votes for English laws? A policy announced within minutes of the independence referendum result. It served only to pour petrol on the deep rooted divisions in our country. 

This was swiftly followed by an election campaign which pitted Scotland against England. And then 12 months later, the Tories told us that all that mattered in the Scottish election campaign was whether you'd voted yes or no. 

And here we are now, watching all these Tory leadership candidates falling over each other to tell us how they're going to stitch together a country they've ripped apart. 

When you sit back and think about it - the Tories have treated politics like some big old jolly game to be played in the grounds of Eton. Where every move is terribly clever, but the consequences ignored. 

Meanwhile ordinary workers jobs and pensions hang in the balance. 

""You can only trust the Tories to stand up for the union."" That's one slogan I don't want to ever hear again. 

It's this type of spin and lies that turns people off from politics right at the time we need the whole country to be engaged in what happens next.

Scottish politicians need to face up to the reality that Scotland is not immune to the deep divisions that made people vote leave in England and Wales. 

All parties, but especially the Labour Party,have to seek to understand why so many people voted for the risk of leaving the European Union rather than the prospect of change inside the EU. 

We in the Labour Party, and across the Labour movement, need to recognise that it wasn't just disenchantment with the Tory party that brought this Leave result home. 

It was disdain for an entire political class who look out of touch, elitist, deaf to the concerns that people are raising and with no answers to the big challenges our country is facing. 

This result is a reckoning for the political establishment and we all need to come to terms with it. 

Here in Scotland, we are not immune from this. 

Over a million people voted leave, but the public debate we've been having since the UK voted leave would make you think that we voted unanimously for remain. 

Let me say this. 

I don't agree with the arguments made by leave campaigners. 

They were deeply wrong and the campaign that they ran plumbed the depths of political campaigning. 

But I can no more ignore the concerns of people who voted leave than I would ignore the concerns of someone who voted yes. 

Yet here in Scotland there has been no attempt in the past two weeks to reach out to leave voters. There's been no effort made to find out why they voted the way they did and ask them why they were willing to risk a leap in the dark.

The places where high leave votes were found in Scotland are some of the poorest communities in our country. 

Many of them are also places that voted in large numbers for yes in the Scottish referendum. 

For example, in the east end of Glasgow, 44% of people voted leave. 

In total, over one million people in Scotland cast their vote for leave two weeks ago. 

Politicians of every party in Scotland need to face up to the fact that we are not immune to the deep divisions that made people vote leave in England and Wales. 

It's a wake up call to us in the Labour Party too. 

We came into politics to fight against poverty and to create a more united society. 

So we need to ask ourselves why people in the very communities we seek to represent weren't convinced by our argument both at the independence referendum and at the EU referendum. 

We need to understand why they felt the gamble of independence or the gamble of leaving the EU was a better prospect than fighting for change within the system we have. 

In the same way as my party has sought to bridge the divide between people who voted yes and no, we need to heal the divisions between people who voted remain and leave. If we fail to do that it will only confirm for people that politics is remote, distant and can achieve nothing for them at all.",Scottish Labour Party,video,https://www.facebook.com/ScottishLabourParty/videos/1079867762105423/,2016-07-07 06:23:50,50,27,0,46,1,0,0,3,0

The social, political and economic order has been turned upside down. It will take many months and years for us to fully grasp the consequences.

The Labour Party will support the government's efforts to not only mitigate the worst of Brexit, but to strengthen Scotland's ties with our European neighbours and allies.

The priority must be securing jobs and the rights of workers.

And all options for protecting Scotland's place in the single market must be explored, including a federalised United Kingdom which could see those nations of the UK who voted to remain, retain their membership or achieve associated status.

So the First Minister may have left the chamber with the faith of the Labour benches to speak to Europe in the best interests of securing Scotland's future in both the EU and the UK. 

But that faith can only be maintained by regular communication, involvement and briefings from the government to opposition parties.

A faith maintained by a continued understanding that as First Minister, she travels to Europe with a duty to represent Scots that voted both Yes and No, Scots that voted both remain and to leave. 

But that faith would be betrayed if the First Minister tries to present our support for the motion as support for a second independence referendum. 

I struggle to put into words the anger I feel towards the Conservative party at the moment. An anger that's been building since David Cameron announced English Votes for English laws within minutes of the Scottish Independence Referendum result. 

An anger that grew when her party set Scottish voters against English voters in a hugely divisive and disingenuous 2015 campaign. 

Anger at a party that forced this EU referendum on a country that did not want it, only to resolve an ego contest in the Tory party. 

And a Tory campaign in last month's election that told the nation that all that mattered was whether you were a unionist or a nationalist. 

A campaign that had no vision for Scotland whatsoever and boiled down to just two key messages: 1) You can only trust the Tories to protect the union â how is that going now Ruth? and 2) That the Tories would offer a ""strong opposition"" and all that they stand opposed to today, is giving the First Minister some support to speak to EU institutions about our future.

The Tories have put the future of the UK in danger at every turn and it's high time they shouldered responsibility for that.

The SNP should reverse cuts to student bursaries, as new figures published today confirmed that the number of people from poor backgrounds going to university has dropped.

In the last year the number of people from poor backgrounds applying to university dropped by 3% and the number attending university dropped by 7%, according to UCAS.

Under the SNP Government student grants and bursaries have been cut by one third.

At First Minister's Questions today, I called on the SNP to reverse cuts to bursaries. Labour's manifesto for the 2016 election pledged to reinstate bursaries for the poorest students to their highest level.

I also called on Nicola Sturgeon to guarantee funding for a government scheme designed to secure university places for people from poor backgrounds.

Nicola Sturgeon was named the 50th most powerful person in the world this week. It's time she started using her power to give young people in Scotland a fair chance in life.

What the UCAS figures show is that there has been a drop in the number of people from poor backgrounds applying to university, and an even bigger drop in the number of poor students making it to university. That's what happens when the SNP Government has cut student grants and bursaries by a third. It's a national scandal.

In an era of unpredictability in politics across the world, the one thing people consistently call for is political leaders to be straight with them. Straight answers to straight questions is what people want.

During the election Labour made a manifesto commitment to ban fracking in Scotland. No ifs, no buts, no fracking. The science is clear - if we want to protect our environment and meet our climate change goals then the last thing we should do is develop a new fossil fuel.

We put our straight forward position to vote in Parliament and called on the other parties to be straight with the people of Scotland - do you back an outright ban on fracking in Scotland?

The Lib Dems and the Greens are opposed to fracking, so they supported our motion. The Tories favour fracking so they voted against.

The SNP? Well they abstained. So confused is their position on fracking that they couldn't decide whether to vote for or against an outright ban. In the end they did neither. Despite claiming to be against fracking, the SNP choked when it matters. It's that kind of cynical action that puts people right off politics.

The very next day after the fracking vote the SNP showed their true colours again. Another Labour motion called for a higher rate of tax on the richest 1%. At a time of massive cuts to public services, to schools and the NHS, the richest few should pay their fair share.

Labour called for higher taxes on the rich in our manifesto so we voted for that proposal in Parliament. Just a few weeks after the election voters would expect us to stick to our principles.

What did the SNP do? This time they joined with the Tories to vote against the wealthiest paying their fair share. That's despite Nicola Sturgeon claiming to support that very thing during the election.

Having lost their majority in Parliament the SNP will be faced with a choice - they can work with parties of the left like Labour to ban fracking and stop the cuts to our public services. Or they can side with the Tories to force through more cuts to schools and the NHS.

People want political leaders who are authentic, who support the same things before and after an election. Labour will continue to stand up for our values and force the SNP to make a choice.

The question for Nicola Sturgeon now is this - whose side is she on?",,status,,2016-06-07 11:45:28,57,9,9,56,0,0,0,0,1

1595489564062253_1742097222734819,"#ICYMI :  My weekly Daily Record column from Monday

I knew immigration would be front and centre of the EU Leave campaign eventually, but that doesn't make it any better now that it is actually happening.

Yesterday Michael Gove and Boris Johnson, Conservative Cabinet Ministers, wrote to David Cameron urging him to accept the government's failure to reduce migration because we are part of the EU. The economic case for leaving the EU has been comprehensively demolished, so those advocating our withdrawal from the European Union have resorted to scare stories about immigration.

One newspaper supportive of the Leave campaign recently had a headline warning that 12 million people from Turkey would come to the UK if that country joined the EU. It would be laughable were it not so serious.

In the world of so many of those campaigning to leave the EU, particularly the likes of UKIP leader Nigel Farage and Tories like Iain Duncan Smith, immigration is to blame for all of our problems. Bad jobs figures? Blame immigration. Problems in the NHS? Blame immigration.

All too rarely do we hear politicians make a passionate defence of immigration. It's considered an unwritten rule of politics that being too pro-immigration is a no-no. I disagree.

It's a simple fact of life that to grow our economy and to pay the pensions of our increasingly older population, we need to attract people from across the world to the UK. We need young people to study in our universities, we need scientists to support our research projects, we need business leaders to invest in our communities. Shutting ourselves off from the world isn't just narrow minded, it makes no economic sense.

People who come to live and work here contribute a massive amount to our economy and, crucially, to our public services. Our NHS is heavily reliant on staff from across the world. Anybody who has used our health service knows the massive role people from other parts of the world play â from the most gifted surgeons, to GPs, nurses, auxiliary staff and more. We are lucky to have them working for our NHS and we should celebrate their contribution.

Those of us who want to live in a multi-cultural, outward looking nation, who believe that immigration is a good thing from both a social and economic standpoint, need to have the courage of our convictions. We need to stand up to the likes of Michael Gove and Nigel Farage once and for all.",,status,,2016-06-05 05:09:19,97,27,18,92,2,0,1,0,2

It's not just because it benefits us in terms of jobs and trade but because there are so many problems we face that we aren't going to be able to face alone.

The decision we make on June 23 will impact upon the opportunities and support young people get for years to come.

The EU has delivered hundreds of millions of pounds of support to young people in Scotland in the last decade. That's funding we would lose if we voted to leave the EU, but this is about more than just lost money.

Young people in the UK should not lose out on the opportunities that have been afforded to generations before them because we have turned our back on the world. Instead we should continue to co-operate with our friends and neighbours across Europe.

With education and skills firmly at the heart of political debate in Scotland, no party can afford to ignore the positive role the EU plays in opening up opportunities for our young people.

Labour will continue to make the case for the UK staying in Europe, which opens up far more opportunities to our young people than if we walked away.

At First Minister's Questions today I highlighted official figures from this week which showed a growing attainment gap for numeracy amongst school pupils in Scotland. 

The SNP Government's own figures show a scandalous decline in numeracy levels in schools across Scotland. Young people are left without the basic skills they need to prosper and young working class people are denied the chance of going to university. 

Under this SNP Government the budget for education and skills has been cut by 10%. That's a disgrace. Nicola Sturgeon needs to do the numbers and accept she can't cut the attainment gap whilst she is cutting school budgets.

Central to our manifesto will be a pledge to fund a breakfast club in every primary school in Scotland.

Schools across Scotland will be provided with funds for a breakfast club. This money will be in addition to any resources currently used for breakfast clubs at the moment and will average Â£6,500.

For schools already with a breakfast club this will allow for an expansion. For those schools currently without a breakfast club it will allow one to be established.

It would be for individual schools to decide how to use the money for the breakfast club - for example the school can decide the hours the club runs. It will be the first step in developing a childcare policy for Scotland that fits around the lives of parents, not just on an election leaflet.

Labour's manifesto will also protect existing plans to increase pre-school entitlement to 30 hours of free childcare a week, but will emphasise the need for flexible and affordable wrap-around childcare.",Every child deserves a fair start in life,link,http://www.scottishlabour.org.uk/blog/entry/every-child-deserves-a-fair-start-in-life#sthash.BhIhkUS6.hboUeRtN.dpuf,2016-04-27 03:32:47,119,17,43,118,1,0,0,0,0

1595489564062253_1724639584480583,"Since I became Leader of the Scottish Labour Party I've said that we need to be preparing Scotland for the jobs of the future. High skilled, high pay jobs that offer people the best opportunities and give Scotland the possibility to be world-leading in industries at the cutting edge.

To find some of the most high skilled, high pay jobs, however, we sometimes need to look to our industrial heritage to see the possibilities of the future.

Nowhere is that more true than at the shipyards in the Clyde where men and women in recent years have constructed sections of some of the most technologically advanced warships that our Royal Navy have ever possessed.

The ships that now sit, in various stages of construction, in the Rosyth Dockyard are testament to the skills of thousands of shipbuilders across Scotland, and a reminder that shipbuilding in Scotland is as much part of our present as it was of our past.

Everyone was proud last year when the skill of the workers on the Clyde was recognised by the Government when the contract for 13 Type 26 Frigates was awarded to the Clyde yards.

It was a vote of confidence not just in the men and women who worked there, but in the entire future of Scottish shipbuilding. It was a guarantee that the industry â and the jobs that come with it â would be secured well into the future.

Last week, I visited that yard at Govan to talk to the workers there about the future and the ships they are looking forward to working on.

The plans for the Type 26 frigate are so advanced, that I stood and watched a 3D computer generated sailor adjust the functions on the flight deck. The experience was so realistic I could almost reach out and touch it. It's within grasp. That's how the workers at BAE systems feel right now.

As they work on the third of five offshore patrol vessels, everyone is gearing up for the Type 26 frigates which will support jobs at the yard.

That's why the suggestion at the end of last week â after my visit â is such a blow for the workforce there. Reports suggested that the frigates may be delayed by up to a year and the upgrading of the facilities on the Clyde may be abandoned.

With the offshore patrol vehicles still providing work for the yards, there isn't an immediate threat of job losses, but we need to know urgently from the Government what their new plans are for the timetable and whether there is going to be any gap between the current contracts ending and the Type 26 frigate beginning.

We also need to know that the Government remains committed to building at least 13 Type 26 frigates on the Clyde and that the promised upgrade of the facilities there will be carried through. This is important because we don't just need to see the jobs retained now, but the promise of investment met so that Clyde shipbuilding can have a long and certain future.

If the Tory Government delivers anything short of what they promised then it will be a deep betrayal to the workers on the Clyde and their families.

Before the election, the Labour Party was absolutely clear that we would meet the promises we made to the shipbuilding industry, and it's bitterly disappointing that we aren't in Government now to see that promise through.

As Leader of the Labour Party, I won't play politics with these jobs and our shipbuilding industry. It's far too important for that. But I won't stay silent when people propose actions that would put a at risk â whether that's the UK Government's delay or the SNP's plans for independence.

This week, I plan to visit the yards again to speak with the workers â many of whom I stood side by side with when they campaigned against independence to secure their industry. I want to hear from them directly about what this delay will mean for them and their families and see what more I can do to help. .

These Frigates must be delivered on the Clyde as promised. We won't stand for anything less.",,status,,2016-04-25 05:31:59,134,18,10,128,6,0,0,0,0

1. Reverse George Osborne's tax cut for higher rate tax payers.

2. Introduce a 50p top rate of tax for the richest 1% earning more than Â£150,000 a year to invest in education

3. Ban public contracts for firms that avoid tax

4. Set the rate of income tax just 1p higher than George Osborne to stop the cuts to public services like schools and the NHS

I said that a Labour Scottish Government will implement in full the recommendations of the Naomi Eisenstadt report. We'll bring forward an Anti-Poverty Bill in our first programme for government and we'll use the powers of the Parliament to reverse George Osborne's tax cut for the top 1%.

Everyone in Scotland will lose out unless we use our new powers to stop the cuts. But the SNP are too scared to upset the richest to protect the rest of us. The poorest will lose the most from the cuts to come.
 
We can't ask the poorest families in Scotland to continue to bear the burden of these cuts. The SNP budget cut hundreds of millions of pounds from schools and local services â if you're serious about tackling child poverty you can't cut the budget for Scotland's schools.
 
It's not good enough for Scottish politicians to talk about being anti-poverty when we have the opportunity to actually do something about it. My plan is clear â we'll ask the wealthiest few to pay just a little bit more. The price of not doing that - more cuts, more jobs lost and more children living in poverty - is simply too great.

People deserve bold proposals from the next Scottish Government, not broken promises. Labour's fair plans will see 80% of households pay less. That means the average household will be better off by Â£111.

We will make good on the SNP's broken promise to scrap the council tax and fix local government finance for good, rather than carry on the SNP's cuts to councils.

It would be unforgivable for the SNP to have campaigned against austerity for years, only to stand aside at the crucial moment. 

The SNP have already imposed cuts worth hundreds of millions of pounds to schools and other vital local services. If we don't use the tax powers to stop the cuts then the impact will be fewer staff in our schools, thousands of people out of work and the very fabric of our society at risk.

1595489564062253_1702580570019818,"Happy International Women's Day!

If you agree with the below - PLEASE SHARE!

#PledgeForParity

The theme for this year's International Women's Day is ""pledge for parity"". It continues to disappoint me that despite it being 2016 we are still fighting for 52% of the global population to be treated as equals.

We have made significant strides for women, but many of those strides make up the tapestry of feminist history that has come before us, led by the Emmeline Pankhursts and Mary Barbours of the world. In recent years those strides have become baby steps.

Look at the representation of women in the Scottish Parliament. In 2003, women made up 40% of the total numbers of MSPs. Today, that figure is just 35%. It is likely that the upcoming Scottish Parliament election will see this increase again, but these figures illustrate exactly why we cannot assume that the fight for female equality is won. It's an ongoing battle. That's why I set up the Women 5050 campaign with Alison Johnstone MSP, a cross party effort campaigning for at least 50% of the candidates in local and national elections to be women.

The fact that the three main political parties in Scotland are led by women is a good thing, but can you hand on heart say that has dramatically altered the life of women in Scotland? I don't think we can. Having more women in parliament, and crucially a diverse set of women, will make a difference, but only if it impacts the decisions that are made there.

The recently passed SNP Government budget was one of cuts and passing-the-buck austerity. Hundreds of millions of pounds has been cut from schools and local services. And which section of society relies on public services most? Women.

Since the Tories came to power in Westminster with their austerity agenda, experts have shown time and again that women disproportionately bare the front of cuts. The same outcome will be felt by women in Scotland with this SNP budget.

Last week it was reported that widening access initiatives across universities to help those from the poorest backgrounds enter higher education are being cut. Who suffers most? Those who are furthest from entering education and employment - working class and BME women.

We have childcare policy which is rooted in a rigid approach of hours per child. The Care Inspectorate released a report just last week calling childcare in Scotland inflexible and unworkable. It found that some local authorities were only able to provide 3 hour blocks of care. The way to support mothers back into work isn't to give them just three hours of childcare a day.

It is not enough, though, for me to just point out the failures of the government. I have been setting out the bold action I would take to improve the lives of women across Scotland.

The powers of the Scottish Parliament are substantial and I think it's about time the government started making the most of them. I want to set the Scottish rate of Income Tax just 1p higher than the rate set by George Osborne so we can stop the SNP's cuts to schools and childcare. The wealthiest would pay the most, but everybody would benefit.

I also want to use the new social security powers to lift children out of poverty. The Sure Start Maternity Grant has been stuck at Â£500 for years. Scottish Labour would more than double this to Â£1030, so that new mums can buy the things their children need â nappies, a pram, a cot and much more.

This International Women's Day let's 'pledge for parity', not only in our representation but in our policies.",,status,,2016-03-08 12:00:00,37,0,19,37,0,0,0,0,0

The Scottish Parliament has a tremendous amount of new powers. I think we should use those powers so every child gets the best possible start in life.

We would make the Sure Start Maternity Grant Â£1030 rather than just Â£500.

A survey by the Money Advice Service about how much it costs to have a baby shows that the average cost of having a baby in 2016 for the poorest families is Â£1565. It is Â£3710 for the richest.

So if we have a maternity grant which Â­covers the cost of a buggy, a Moses basket and Â­nappies for a year, I think that would be a great start.

Scottish Labour would set the Scottish rate of income tax 1 penny higher than the rate set by George Osborne. That means we can end the cuts, not enforce them.

For the last two weeks we've been having a grown up debate about how we support our public services .

Labour want to invest, the SNP and the Tories want to keep cutting. We know where we all stand now.

There are more powers on the way once a financial deal between the UK and Scottish Governments is agreed - the so called fiscal framework.

When these powers arrive, we can be even bolder in the decisions we make to stop the cuts in Scotland and give young people a chance to get on in life. It's an amazing opportunity for Scotland to chart a difference course, if our politicians are brave enough to take it.

Taking on responsibility for Scottish taxes means we should shoulder the risks but it shouldn't mean losing the rewards we get from being part of the UK and the system that shares money out across the country.

It's absolutely right that Nicola Sturgeon should be arguing for this, as Labour always has. This is the glue that holds together the system of pooling and sharing across the UK and we're all stronger for it.

There is now broad agreement amongst the parties here that the Barnett Formula â the calculation that determines how much money we have to spend on our public services - is a good thing that benefits Scotland and anything that puts it at risk should be resisted.

The deal that is struck between the two governments will largely decide how much money the Scottish Government has to spend on schools and the NHS not just now but for many years in to the future.

The Labour Party has fully supported the Scottish Government to get the best deal for Scotland since the start of these negotiations. That's because getting a deal will unlock the powers that we all want for the Scottish Parliament.

To give every young person in Scotland the best possible start in life we must cut the gap between the richest and the rest in our classrooms but right now it is a postcode lottery.

Nicola Sturgeon said education would be her number one priority â but in parts of the country she is doing nothing to help.

The SNP budget will just make things worse, with Â£500 million of cuts to local councils for services like schools.

A Scottish Labour Government would ask those lucky enough to earn over Â£150,000 a year to pay a little bit more in tax so we can create a Fair Start Fund to invest in our young people.

Despite not meeting existing pledges, Nicola Sturgeon has promised every child 1140 hours of free childcare by 2020. 

The campaign group Fair Funding For Our Kids has confirmed this would require the equivalent of 650 new nurseries to be built, and mean allocation for an extra 26,000 children.

Evidence suggests that a move to a soft opt-out system could increase donation rates by up to 30%.

Our plan would effectively double the help first time buyers currently receive towards saving for a deposit. A person who currently saves through a first-time buyer ISA up to the value of Â£3,000 would be entitled to an additional Â£3,000 from a Scottish Labour Government to help toward the cost of a deposit to buy a property.

Nicola Sturgeon came to this plant a few weeks ago and promised steel workers that she would do everything possible to save their jobs. The clock is ticking and it's time the government delivered on those promises.

If we are serious about saving the Scottish steel industry we need a positive commitment from the SNP Government that they will preserve both the industrial assets and the skills of the workforce, while a new commercial operator is found.

Steel can have a bright future in Scotland and right across the UK.

If we can give every child a world class education then they, and Scotland, will be able to take advantage of the amazing opportunities the future will bring.

That's why the Scottish Labour Party will amend the Education Bill to use the new powers coming to the Scottish Parliament to create a fair start fund.

Our fair start fund will mean Â£1000 of extra investment in children from Scotland's poorest families so we can cut the gap between the richest and the rest in our classrooms

We want to give the spending powers to head teachers, challenges in classrooms are different across the country, in fact they are different across the same city. That's why these decisions should be taken by head teachers rather than by an SNP Minister in Edinburgh.

All Scots want to extend our deepest sympathy to the people of France. The brutal and co-ordinated attack in Paris was an attack on all of us, not just across Europe but across the world. 

We still don't know all of the details of all of the attacks, but we do know that more than 120 lost their lives at the hands of people prepared to die in the course of spreading terror among the population.

In Paris, just as in Edinburgh and Washington and New York and Philadelphia, we take for granted the ordinary freedom to go out on Friday night to the theatre or a football match.

We expect to be able to do these things and return home safely to our families at the end of the night. 

In Paris last night, that ordinary freedom was stolen.  

The purpose of terror is to make us afraid of one another, to be fearful of the ordinary, and to make us suspicious of our neighbours.

But now more than ever we need to remind ourselves of what brings us together as human beings, as brothers and sisters, as neighbours, colleagues and friends whatever our creed or colour, whatever our background.

I have already said that I want people to take another look at the Labour Party. I want to say that again today. I hope that those who were lost to us in the past will start to listen again as both Jeremy and I put forward radical policies that we hope will win back support for Labour.

We've now got the chance for a fresh start and new leadership in both Scotland and across the UK. I've said I want my leadership to be about shaking up the establishment in Scotland, and Jeremy wants to do the same across the UK.

There is growing anger that our government refuses to offer a safe home for refugees. We share this anger and feel compassion for those desperately looking for safety.
 
We will match our compassion with action. 

We are mobilising the campaigning resources of the Scottish Labour Party to welcome those fleeing conflict to our communities. Labour Councils around Scotland are already working to resettle refugees. 

We will step up these efforts and together make clear that we are ready to welcome people.
