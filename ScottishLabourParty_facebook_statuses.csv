Energy Action Scotland is aiming to have a strong message delivered across social media on the last day of November 2016 to urge Scottish Ministers to reset the fuel poverty target.
 
Energy Action Scotland (EAS) is the national charity which campaigns to end fuel poverty and works to promote warm, dry homes for all.
 
The Scottish Government was required to eradicate fuel poverty by November 2016 under the Housing (Scotland) Act 2001.
The Scottish Government announced in June this year that it wasn't going to meet the target. In fact fuel poverty levels in Scotland are rising. The most recent figures show that 34.9% of the population are in fuel poverty.  Fuel poverty means living in a cold, damp home. Fuel poverty results in misery, ill health, debt and discomfort.

Places available through the Skills Development Scotland 'employability fund' have been reduced from 17,302 to 11,397 – a 34 per cent cut.

The fund enables local training providers to work with employers to understand their skills needs and help them find and train the right individuals.

""Mental health should be every bit as important to government policy as physical health.""

""Scotland has made some strides in removing the taboos and stigma associated with mental health, but recent findings in the Scottish Social Attitudes Survey still show we have a way to go, particularly in understanding depression.""

""The SNP government in Edinburgh so far simply has not been good enough on mental health. The waiting times figures for treatment for those with mental health conditions are nothing short of scandalous and simply would not be tolerated if replicated in A&E wards or GP surgeries, and further cuts to local services will only make this worse.""

""Scotland's forthcoming mental health strategy is an opportunity to start to get things right, all parties say they support parity for mental health, now it's time to deliver it.""

Three months ago, I joined the First Minister and hundreds of people to pay tribute to Jo Cox at an emotional vigil.
One day earlier, the 41-year-old Labour MP had been killed in the street outside her constituency surgery in Birstall, near Leeds.
At the heartbreaking vigil in Glasgow, I expressed my hope that Jo's legacy would be a 'new beginning for our politics'.

There should be a renewed focus on the day job from the SNP 

This weekend marks the second anniversary of the SNP's referendum on Scottish independence that divided our nation.
Two years on, the divisions caused by that historic contest have not healed.

On social media and in the real word, the scars that are Alex Salmond's political legacy remain painfully obvious.
Anonymous internet users hurl abuse at people they will never meet, politicians from all parties are on the receiving end of foul language, and too many people across Scotland feel they must now choose between being labelled a Unionist or a nationalist.

That is not why I got into politics, and it is not why people in the Labour Party got into politics. I want to make a difference to the public services that so many of us rely on, in our hospitals, care homes, our classrooms and elsewhere.

At First Minister's Questions Kez highlighted the case of Anne Maclean-Chang, a mother of two and nurse who has breast cancer. Mrs Maclean-Chang has had to crowd fund to raise money to pay for her £90,000 cancer treatment after her local health board initially refused to cover the costs. This decision has now been overturned after the story was reported in today's Daily Record.

The health board previously said that local GPs would play a part in promoting the Vale of Leven Hospital's maternity unit and encouraging women to use local services. 

However our survey of local practices shows that three quarters of local GPs were not even aware of any marketing activity taking place in their practices at the time of Vision for the Vale. This blows a huge hole through the health board's claims to have actively promoted the services at our local hospital.

We are also campaigning against the following cuts:

- closure of Lightburn Hospital.
- closure of maternity services at Vale of Leven Hospital and Inverclyde Hospital.
- downgrading of paediatric services at the Royal Alexandria Hospital.
- closure on inpatient services at the Centre for Integrated Care at the Gartnaval.
- downgrading of orthopaedics services at Monklands Hospital.

""The SNP Government in Edinburgh make big promises to patients and then don't give our NHS staff the resources they need to deliver. Today we are seeing a string of missed targets and falling performance and the blame lies squarely at the door of the SNP health minister.""

This is wrong. An cabinet minister's assistant can't possibly hold that same minister to account for his or her actions in government.

This year's event included a moving tribute to the victims of last months mass shooting in a gay nightclub in Orlando.

Speaking after the event Kez said-

""This year's Pride march was always going to be big in light of the horrific attacks in Orlando just a few weeks ago, but I wasn't prepared for it to be quite so big!

Within minutes of the Queen leaving the Parliament for the Palace, the Royal Mile was awash with drag kings and queens, Edinburgh's gay rugby club and choir. The racing sound of motorbikes and a dance float in amongst thousands of marchers. Gay, straight, curious - all united by one simple emotion - Pride.

I spoke at the start of the march for the first time and it was a pretty special moment for me having just come out during the election campaign. I told the crowds that I was marching with pride but also with anger, solidarity and hope.Anger at the fact that there are still countless countries in the world where it's illegal to be gay. Countries where the crime of being attracted to someone of the same sex is still punishable by death.

I marched to with a sense of solidarity with the LGBT community in America, deeply scarred by the brutal terrorist attacks in Orlando.
But I also marched with pride and hope. Proud of the incredible journey Scotland has been on since the row over section 28 (2a) Scotland. That referendum battle over the teaching of homosexuality in schools may be nearly 20 years old now, but it's still all too raw for many.

Hope for the future, and for what further progress we can achieve in Scotland. We have not one but four party leaders who identify as LGBT, and we can use that power to create an inclusive society. Wherever can be who they are, safely and at peace with the world.""",,status,,2016-07-04 13:52:13,23,3,1,23,0,0,0,0,0

We must make EU arguments of the heart as well as the head.

Kezia will formally launch the Labour In campaign in Scotland today by urging people not to get complacent in the face of strong poll ratings for a vote to remain in the EU.

At an event in Edinburgh to launch Scottish Labour's pro-EU campaign with Alan Johnson, Chair of Labour In for Britain, Kezia Dugdale will urge people to get out and make the positive case for staying in the EU.

The Scottish Labour leader will also say that although the economic case for staying in the EU is overwhelming, the emotional arguments for remaining in the EU must also be made.

Kezia will say:

""Don't listen to those who say that Scotland is going to vote overwhelmingly to remain in the EU on 23 June.

""The last few weeks have taught us again not to read polls as prediction, as if we needed another lesson after the general election. There's no such thing as a guaranteed win in politics. There can be no complacency when the future of our nation is at stake.

""We may be weary as a nation after three national campaigns in as many years, but we need to do it all over again in the next few weeks.

""We will make the case with passion and conviction.""

Addressing the emotional case for staying in the EU, Kezia Dugdale will say:

""In this debate we must win the head arguments but they have to be combined with a story that reaches people's hearts.

""We will make the economic case: that trade with the EU is essential to Scottish jobs, second only to our domestic market in the UK.

""We will argue the case for workers' rights - that Europe guarantees basic standards at work for millions of Scottish workers, regardless of who is in government.

""We will argue that in a world of constant change and confusing new threats, we are more secure in bigger alliances than alone.

""We will make these arguments, but we will also argue that there is something beautiful about being part of this European family. It isn't found in the grey offices of officials in Brussels or in the columns of national balance sheets, but in lives made more colourful, more fulfilling and more exciting in the cities and towns of Scotland, the UK and 27 other nations.

""My generation, and that of my parents before me, have become so used to that that we don't stop to wonder at the achievement the EU represents.

""From Scandinavia to the Aegean. From the Balearic Islands to the Arctic Circle. From the Carpathians to the Highlands. We cooperate, sharing freedom, together. It's a continent whose history is written in conflict and chaos but is now defined by peace and prosperity.

""We have been part of that. We built that. It's not perfect but it is as extraordinary an achievement as any in our history.

""We are a more European country for having built that union. We are richer for it. Not just the bump in our GDP, as important as that is, but richer for the shared experiences, the mixing of cultures, the people we've come to know, the amazing experiences and opportunities that the EU has brought to us.

""I fear we may not realise that until it's gone.""

Scottish Labour's new MSPs will start work at Holyrood today as the party prepares to take the fight to the SNP from opposition.

Four of Scottish Labour's new group of MSPs have never served in the Scottish or UK Parliament before. They come from careers in business, the charity sector, local government and trade unions.

Speaking ahead of the new MSPs arriving in Holyrood, Kezia said:

""Today marks a fresh start for the Labour Party at Holyrood. Labour will lead progressive opposition to the SNP and our new MSPs – who come with experience from outside politics – will be critical to that success.

""We need all their talents to rebuild for the long term. Over the next five years the Scottish Parliament will take responsibility for a whole host of new powers, including over tax and welfare.

""With a minority SNP government, we will put forward progressive proposals for how the new Parliament should use those powers in the best interests of the people of Scotland. If the SNP are looking for our support they will need to be bold and radical in how they use the new powers of the Parliament.""

Our manifesto contained many proposals for reforming the Scottish Parliament that received backing from all opposition parties. 

We will work with other parties to make them a reality.

Scottish Labour will be a positive and effective opposition and one of the first jobs of opposition is to hold the Government to account and to hold them responsible for the decisions they are making. 

To do that, we need a Scottish Parliament where the many voices of opposition – from all parties – are heard.

As a start, the Presiding Officer and the majority of committee convenorships should not come from the governing party. 

We saw in the last term that SNP dominated committees did not provide anywhere near the level of scrutiny that the Government's work required. We will work to change that.

But we must go further. People require confidence that the politicians they elect to serve are giving them the full attention they deserve. 

Being a member of the Scottish Parliament is an immense privilege and it should be the only job that MSPs do. That is why we will push for a ban on MSPs holding second jobs, including paid directorships and consultancies.

→ Protect the winter fuel payment and take action against fuel poverty.

Campaigning in Edinburgh today, Kezia has said her plans to tax the richest 1% to invest in education and stop the cuts to public services would offer transformational change for Scotland's economy.

By contrast, other parties want to define the next five years about the arguments of the past.

Every Labour MSP sent to Holyrood would be a voice for greater investment in education and public services.

Kezia said:

""Tomorrow we can vote to stop the cuts. In the next five years we can use the new powers of our parliament to transform our economy. We can invest in education to give our young people the skills they need to compete for the jobs of the future.

""The best future for our country is as a high wage, high skill economy. To get there we need to invest in cutting the gap between the richest and the rest in our classrooms, and we need to stop the cuts to public services.

""Other parties want to spend the next five years arguing about the past, when Scotland just wants to move on and help our people get on. I have three priories for the next five years – use the new powers of our Parliament to tax the richest 1% so we can invest in schools, and stop the cuts to public services. Every Labour MSP we send to Holyrood will stand for those priorities.

New analysis from Scottish Labour shows that every part of Scotland will benefit from higher spending on public services under Labour's plan compared to the SNP:

→ Aberdeen would be the equivalent of £137 million better off with Labour than the SNP.
→ Glasgow would be the equivalent of £336 million better off.
→ Dundee would be the equivalent of £83 million better off.
→ Edinburgh would be the equivalent of £276 million better off.
→ Fife would be the equivalent of £162 million better off.

In key constituencies:

→ Edinburgh Eastern, where Kezia Dugdale is standing, would be the equivalent of £45 million better off under Labour compared to the SNP.
→ Glasgow Southside, where Nicola Sturgeon is standing, would be the equivalent of £37 million better off under Labour.
→ Edinburgh Central, where Ruth Davidson is standing, would be the equivalent of £46 million better off under Labour.

These figures show that people who want to tax the richest 1% to invest in schools and stop the cuts to public services need to use both their votes for Labour on Thursday.

Our manifesto sets out a clear plan to use the powers of the Scottish Parliament to invest in the future and stop the cuts.

Nicola Sturgeon and Ruth Davidson are running dishonest campaigns in an attempt to deceive the Scottish people. Nicola Sturgeon wants people to believe that we can stop the cuts but refuses to ask anybody, including the richest 1%, to pay more to make that happen. Ruth Davidson says she will stand up to the SNP but you can't get a fag paper between the tax plans of the two parties. 

Only we have an honest plan to invest in Scotland's future and stop the cuts. Faced with the choice between using the powers of the Scottish Parliament to invest in the future or carrying on with the cuts, Labour will use the powers to stop the cuts.

On the news, Ian Murray MP said: 
""The Trade Union Bill was an unjust and undemocratic attack on workers' and trades unions' rights across the country. That is why Labour has fought this Bill every step of the way.

""We are pleased that the Government has listened to the arguments we have made in the Commons and Lords, and taken account of the proposals in the report of the cross-party House of Lords joint committee set up by Labour's Lords amendments.

""Our efforts in the Lords have ensured that many of the worst elements – the restrictions to facilities time and check off and the attack on political funds – have been removed. 

""In Scotland, Labour councils led opposition to the Bill by passing motions of non-compliance. And Labour MSPs strained every sinew to block the passage of the Bill, petitioning the Scottish Parliament to change the rules to allow for a legislative consent motion – a proposal that was blocked by the SNP, the Liberal Democrats and the Tories.

""Labour in Scotland and across the UK will always fight for the rights of working people and solidarity with our friends in the trade union movement.""

Schools across Scotland will be provided with funds for a breakfast club. This money will be in addition to any resources currently used for breakfast clubs at the moment and will average £6,500. For schools already with a breakfast club this will allow for an expansion. For those schools currently without a breakfast club it will allow one to be established.

It would be for individual schools to decide how to use the money for the breakfast club - for example the school can decide the hours the club runs. It will be the first step in developing a childcare policy for Scotland that fits around the lives of parents, not just on an election leaflet.

Labour's manifesto will also protect existing plans to increase pre-school entitlement to 30 hours of free childcare a week, but will emphasise the need for flexible and affordable wrap-around childcare.

Our other pledges for children include:

→ A Fair Start Fund from the 50p top rate of tax on those earning more than £150,000 a year to invest in cutting the attainment gap between the richest and rest in our classrooms
→ Protection of the education budget in real terms
→ Reforming the senior phase of school with a Scottish Graduation Certificate involving vocational courses, work experience and traditional exams. This would allow formal recognition for young people with fewer traditional qualifications
→ Funding primary school teachers to go on a basic coding course to empower them to introduce it to pupils as early as possible
→ Scrapping charges for exam appeals
→ Protecting free university tuition
→ Reverse the SNP's cuts to bursaries for the poorest students in Higher Education
→ Guarantee support for students in Further Education

The move has previously been supported by anti-poverty charities including the Child Poverty Action Group, Scottish Council for Voluntary Organisations and the Poverty Alliance.

The current system does not allow claimants to the Scottish Welfare Fund to choose cash payments, which third sector groups have argued decreases independence for claimants and can ultimately be more costly.

Kezia also outlined our further plans for a fairer social security system, including

- Ensuring that children leaving care and going into higher education get a full grant, and not the bare minimum.
- Abolishing the bedroom tax once and for all, using new powers over Universal Credit.
- Supporting carers by raising carers' allowance to the same level as Jobseekers' Allowance.
- Tackling child poverty by doubling the Sure Start maternity grant, increasing its value to £1,030.

Our plan for a greener Scotland includes:
→ A ban on fracking
→ A ground-breaking Warm Homes Act to update regulations to tackle fuel poverty by driving up energy and insulation standards
→ Cancelling the SNP's plan to cut air passenger duty which will lead to an annual increase in greenhouse gas emissions of 50,000 tonnes.

Climate change is the great challenge for this generation, and the next Scottish Government must take action to tackle it now. 

Kezia said:
""The greatest global challenge facing my generation is climate change. The next Scottish Government needs to offer more than warms words; it needs to deliver real change.

""A Labour Scottish Government will ban fracking. Science tells us the last thing our climate needs is another fossil fuel. With Labour there will be no ifs, no buts, no fracking in Scotland.

""The SNP's approach to climate change is similar to its whole approach to government - set a target, miss it and then set an even tougher target in the hope nobody notices.

""Labour will deliver a Scottish Government that finally implements the policies to match our ambitions on the environment and climate change. Labour will use the powers to deliver a greener, fairer Scotland.""

A Labour Scottish Government will invest £40 million a year in after-school sports clubs.

Labour will use the Barnett consequentials from the recently announced sugar tax to deliver funding worth an average of over £100,000 per secondary school, dependent on school rolls.

This investment will be part of a wider move to make local schools and the associated facilities the hub of community sport activity as part of Labour's plans to use the new powers of the Scottish Parliament to stop the cuts.

Kezia said:
""This can be a revolution for after-school sport in Scotland. The positive benefits of sport and healthier lifestyles for our young people will be felt all across our country, from less pressure on our NHS to higher achievement in our classrooms.

""Every single young person in Scotland deserves the best possible start in life. With a Labour Scottish Government that will mean a world class education in the classroom and the opportunity to get involved in sport after school.

""After-school clubs and extracurricular activities are where young people find out who they are and what they're good at. Cutting education will cut the opportunities our children enjoy. That's why Labour will use the new powers to stop the cuts and why we will invest £40 million a year in after-school sports clubs.
 
""That kind of investment in sport and healthier lifestyles will have a transformational impact in our classrooms, in our health service and in our economy – if we unearth a few World Cup winners, Wimbledon champions or gold medallists along the way that'll be a bonus.

In the last parliament Labour MSP Anne McTaggart brought forward similar legislation, which was blocked by SNP MSPs who had previously pledged support for the system.

Various groups criticised the SNP for the move, saying that delaying the legislation could cost lives.

Campaigning in Paisley today, Kezia Dugdale said that the Bill would deliver real change to Scots waiting on transplant lists.

A Labour Scottish Government will keep tuition free and reverse the SNP's cuts to Higher Education bursaries for the poorest students so anyone can afford to go to university.

Labour would increase the young student bursary by roughly £900 and the independent student bursary by roughly  £180, reversing the SNP's cuts to student support in Scotland. This restores the value of bursaries in real terms to their highest level in 2012/13.

It will be phased in through above inflation increases over the course of the next parliament and be paid for by Labour's fairer choices on tax to protect the education budget.

Announcing the plans on a visit to Glasgow University today, Kezia said that that a young person's life chances should be determined by their potential, work ethic and talent, not how much money their parents have.

Scottish Labour has also pledged to guarantee financial support for Further Education students.

Kezia said:

""Labour will deliver better student support in Scotland, giving a better and fairer deal to the poorest students.  We will keep tuition free and reverse the SNP's cuts to HigherEducation bursaries for the poorest students so that anyone can afford to go to university.

""We can make that promise because of the different decisions we are taking on tax to invest in education.

1. Kez's only income is the salary she receives as an MSP.

2. Kez donates every single penny from her Daily Record column fee to MND Scotland. The money goes direct from the Daily Record to MND Scotland. However, because this is technically classed as income Kez pays tax on this money. So, she personally doesn't receive a single penny for writing the column but pays hundreds of pounds in tax on it anyway.

A Scottish Labour Government will suspend the current tender of the CalMac ferry routes and take the case to the EU to keep CalMac public.

CalMac ferries are more than just a mode of transport  - they are lifeline links for families and communities.

Last November, the SNP voted against Labour's call to halt the CalMac privatisation process, despite previous promises they would not put the services out to tender.

It's not too late to act. A Scottish Labour Government will suspend the tender process and work to guarantee the Clyde and Hebrides services will not be privatised by taking the case to the EU.

Those who live on Arran and the other islands deserve to know these vital services are safe.

The First Minister confirmed her opposition to increasing taxes on the wealthiest few to invest more in education in an interview where she also effectively conceded that she had cut teacher numbers by 4,000. 

Kezia said:
""With each passing day the SNP's excuses for not reversing George Osborne's tax cut for the richest few look thinner than ever. The SNP won't ask the richest 1% to pay more tax but they will ask our children to pay the price of cuts.

Kezia also challenged Nicola Sturgeon to back Labour's pledge to protect all education spending. This has been a key ask of the teachers' union EIS. Yet again Nicola Sturgeon refused to commit to protecting education spending, meaning even more cuts to schools, colleges and universities. 

Kezia said: 

""The new powers of the Scottish Parliament mean we can stop the cuts. We can take a different path to the Tories and end austerity in Scotland. 

""Faced with a choice between using the powers of this place and passing on Tory austerity, Labour will use our powers.  

""Labour will use the powers to protect education spending in real terms over the next five years. Nicola Sturgeon has campaigned for years on the mantra that more powers mean fewer cuts, but now she has the powers she refuses to use them to stop the cuts to schools.  

""Labour will reverse George Osborne's tax cut for the richest 1% and set a 50p top rate of tax for those earning more than £150,000 a year. Until yesterday the SNP agreed with us but now they refuse to ask the richest 1% to pay their fair share to stop the cuts to schools and vital public services.""

Labour would use the new powers over tax to invest in education to cut the attainment gap, and new powers over social security to build a fairer Scottish welfare state.

Commenting as Scottish Parliament debated the Scotland Bill, Opportunity spokesperson and Smith Commission member Iain Gray outlined how Labour would use the new powers to cut the gap between the richest and the rest in our classrooms.
  
We have set out different choices on tax to stop the cuts to schools and other vital services – including setting a Scottish rate of Income Tax  one penny higher than the rate set by George Osborne; setting a 50p top rate of tax for those earning more than £150,000 to invest extra in education; and not passing on George Osborne's increase in the threshold for the top 15% of earners.
 
The SNP have not spelled out what they would do on tax – except back the Tory plan not to increase the basic rate.
 
Our Opportunity spokesperson Iain Gray said:
 
""The new powers coming to Scotland means we have the chance to radically change Scotland and build a fairer country. Every party should vow to use these powers to stop the cuts and grow our economy.
 
""The most important economic investment we can make in our country's future is in education, and the most important policy we can pursue in education is cutting the gap between the richest and the rest. There is now no reason for the SNP to cut hundreds of millions from schools and local services.
 
""Faced with the choice between using the powers of the Parliament to invest in the future or carrying on with the SNP's cuts to schools, Labour will always choose to use the powers.
 
""Under Labour's plans to use the new powers the wealthiest few would pay the most, including those earning more than £150,000 a year. I want to use that extra money to put power into the hands of teachers, who are best placed to take decisions about how we close the gap between the richest and the rest.
 
""We can use the new powers over social security to lift children out of poverty. Labour will abolish the bedroom tax, uprate carer's allowance, introduce a full grant for looked after children entering higher education and double the sure start maternity grant for new parents who are struggling.""

310039442421596_1004541019638098,"ANNOUNCED TODAY: Our plan for a transport system that works for commuters, not transport bosses 

The next Scottish Labour Government would regulate Scottish bus services for the first time and legislate for an integrated transport system where one smart ticket can take you across Scotland via all modes of transport.

The integrated transport system would be underpinned by new regulation which would provide transport authorities with powers to set service levels and group profitable routes with non-profitable routes.

Despite promising a nationwide smartcard by 2014, the SNP Government has still failed to deliver it with testing only beginning recently and no date set for full roll out. Scottish Labour's plans would be compulsory, apply to all transport operators and would see the roll out within the first year of the new Government and the switch to contactless credit or debit cards by the end of the next Parliament.

Announcing the policy, Kezia said:
""We need a transport system that works for commuters, not transport bosses. Right now, the Scottish transport system is a patchwork of services and many areas are left behind with no decent provision. That's why we will legislate for an integrated transport system with regulated bus services and one smart ticket that can take you across Scotland.

""People should be able to travel the length and breadth of our country with one card in their pocket. In 2012, we were told this wasn't far off, but in 2016 we're still waiting. London has had a single smartcard for thirteen years and have recently started taking payments using contactless credit and debit cards. The technology exists – all we need is the political will to deliver it.

""The last Labour Scottish Government introduced concessionary travel for older people – a policy we are proud of. The next Labour Government will make it even easier for more people to move from their own cars to a fully integrated public transport system. Times are tough for people, we will make it cheaper and easier to get to work.""

Analysis from the Office for National Statistics has shown that the SNP's plan to halve air passenger duty would save the top 20% of earners £73 whilst the poorest would save just £4.50.

With new powers coming to Scotland over tax, we have challenged the SNP to ditch the tax breaks for the richest and instead back Labour's plans to use money to help first time buyers save towards a deposit. 

Our plan would effectively double the help first time buyers currently receive towards saving for a deposit. 

A person who currently saves through a first-time buyer ISA up to the value of £3,000 would be entitled to an additional £3,000 from a Scottish Labour Government to help toward the cost of a deposit to buy a property. 

Under this plan, the average couple each saving £100 a month would be able to save for a £15,000 deposit within three years.

The SNP Budget cut spending for fuel poverty measures by £15 million – a 13% cut to the current budget.

224,00 pensioners in Scotland live in fuel poverty according to the latest figures.

Cuts to the fuel poverty budget were short-sighted and counterproductive as it was likely to increase the strain on public services like the NHS and social care with more pensioners at risk.

We've pledged a Warm Homes Act, which will change building and planning regulations to tackle fuel poverty.

Our Communities spokesperson Ken Macintosh said:

""Over 200,000 pensioners in Scotland live in fuel poverty. The response of the SNP government to that figure is not to take action, but to slash the budget for fuel poverty measures by more than 10%.

""The last Labour-led Government set an ambitious target to eradicate fuel poverty by 2016. The SNP are going to miss that target by a mile.

""These short-sighted cuts are simply wrong from the SNP. Cutting fuel poverty measures will simply increase the already huge pressure on public services like the NHS and social care services.

""Labour will deliver a ground-breaking Scottish Warm Homes Act. This will deliver the changes we need to see in planning and building regulations to tackle fuel poverty.

The First Minister wants to dismiss her cuts to education, but behind every number is someone whose life has been turned upside down because of decisions made by the SNP Government.

People in our schools are losing their jobs and the staff that remain face even greater pressure. It's our young people who will lose out because of this government's cuts to education.

For years the First Minister said independence was the way to stop the cuts, but that argument is now dead. Labour have set out a plan to use the powers of this Parliament to stop the cuts - but on the 50p tax, the higher rate threshold and the 1p plan she has voted it down each and every time.

It's time for Nicola Sturgeon to spell out exactly what she will do to stop the cuts.

We have set out different choices on tax to stop the cuts to schools and other vital services – including setting a Scottish rate of Income Tax 1p higher than the rate set by George Osborne; set a 50p top rate of tax for those earning more than £150,000 to invest more in education; and not passing on George Osborne's increase in the threshold for the top 15% of earners.

On a visit to Peebles High School today Kezia discussed with senior pupils her plans to reform the senior phase of school with a Scottish Graduation Certificate.

The Scottish Graduation Certificate would be a qualification gained at the senior phase of secondary school and would involve vocational courses, work experience and traditional exams. This would allow formal recognition for young people with fewer traditional qualifications.

We would also reform spending plans for cutting the gap between the richest and the rest with a Fair Start Fund to cut the attainment gap.

Scottish Labour would use the new powers coming to Scotland to ask those earning more than £150,000 a year to pay a 50p top rate of income tax to invest in our schools to establish a Fair Start Fund. This would mean an extra £1000 for every primary pupil from a deprived background in Scotland.

Under Labour's plans for Fair Start Fund, Schools in the borders would receive an extra £1.2 million in funding for the attainment gap.

Labour would give head teachers the power to decide how the extra money is spent. That could be additional teachers, classroom assistants or other initiative that have evidenced outcomes.

In their latest budget, Borders Council has been forced to cut their budget for closing the gap by 43%.

Kezia said:

As Councils up and down the country are forced to make swingeing cuts to jobs and services because of the SNP budget, for John Swinney to claim that any impact would be minimal is simply laughable.

We know that Cosla have estimated that 15,000 jobs could go because of SNP cuts. These are cuts which will undermine the future of our country.  There is another way, we can do it differently.

Read below what Kez has written on this year's theme of #PledgeForParity - and how this #IWD we should 'pledge for parity', not only in our representation but in our policies.
 ↓

""The theme for this year's International Women's Day is ""pledge for parity"". It continues to disappoint me that despite it being 2016 we are still fighting for 52% of the global population to be treated as equals.

""We have made significant strides for women, but many of those strides make up the tapestry of feminist history that has come before us, led by the Emmeline Pankhursts and Mary Barbours of the world. In recent years those strides have become baby steps.

""Look at the representation of women in the Scottish Parliament. In 2003, women made up 40% of the total numbers of MSPs. Today, that figure is just 35%. It is likely that the upcoming Scottish Parliament election will see this increase again, but these figures illustrate exactly why we cannot assume that the fight for female equality is won. It's an ongoing battle. That's why I set up the Women 5050 campaign with Alison Johnstone MSP, a cross party effort campaigning for at least 50% of the candidates in local and national elections to be women.

""The fact that the three main political parties in Scotland are led by women is a good thing, but can you hand on heart say that has dramatically altered the life of women in Scotland? I don't think we can. Having more women in parliament, and crucially a diverse set of women, will make a difference, but only if it impacts the decisions that are made there.

""The recently passed SNP Government budget was one of cuts and passing-the-buck austerity. Hundreds of millions of pounds has been cut from schools and local services. And which section of society relies on public services most? Women.

""Since the Tories came to power in Westminster with their austerity agenda, experts have shown time and again that women disproportionately bare the front of cuts. The same outcome will be felt by women in Scotland with this SNP budget.

""Last week it was reported that widening access initiatives across universities to help those from the poorest backgrounds enter higher education are being cut. Who suffers most? Those who are furthest from entering education and employment - working class and BME women.

""We have childcare policy which is rooted in a rigid approach of hours per child.  The Care Inspectorate released a report just last week calling childcare in Scotland inflexible and unworkable. It found that some local authorities were only able to provide 3 hour blocks of care. The way to support mothers back into work isn't to give them just three hours of childcare a day.

""It is not enough, though, for me to just point out the failures of the government. I have been setting out the bold action I would take to improve the lives of women across Scotland.

""The powers of the Scottish Parliament are substantial and I think it's about time the government started making the most of them. I want to set the Scottish rate of Income Tax just 1p higher than the rate set by George Osborne so we can stop the SNP's cuts to schools and childcare. The wealthiest would pay the most, but everybody would benefit.

""I also want to use the new social security powers to lift children out of poverty. The Sure Start Maternity Grant has been stuck at £500 for years. Scottish Labour would more than double this to £1030, so that new mums can buy the things their children need – nappies, a pram, a cot and much more.

New analysis after the first anniversary of weekly A&E reporting last Tuesday reveals:

- 92,208 patients waited longer than 4 hours in the past year8,278 patients have waited more than 8 hours in the past year1,284 patients have waited longer than 12 hours in the past year

- More than 7,500 patients have waited more than 4 hours at the £850m flagship Glasgow Queen Elizabeth University Hospital since it opened in May last year.

- More than 1,337 patients waited more than 8 hours at the Royal Edinburgh Infirmary and nearly 350 patients waited more than 12 hours at Hairmyres Hospital in East Kilbride

These figures should act as a 'wake-up call' to the SNP Government about their sticking plaster approach to the NHS and called for greater investment in primary and social care to take the pressure off of our hospitals.

Our Public Services spokesperson Dr Richard Simpson, a former GP with over thirty years' experience said:

""Now more than ever we need a health service based on patient need not the ability to pay.

""Under the SNP government NHS staff are overworked and undervalued, with only a third believing there are enough of them to do their jobs properly.

""The cost of the SNP not supporting our NHS staff is missed waiting times, with tens of thousands of Scots waiting longer than they should for the treatment they need.

""The SNP have had nearly a decade in power and a majority in parliament but won't give our NHS the support it needs to hit the targets they impose.

""Hundreds of millions of pounds of SNP cuts to local services will only increase the pressure on our hospitals. We don't have to accept those cuts.

""Faced with the choice between cuts to public services and using the powers of the Scottish Parliament, Labour would use the powers to invest.""

310039442421596_997208300371370,"Kezia has revealed the extent of the cuts that Scotland will face under another SNP Government, and accused them of a ""dereliction of duty"" as they fail to spell out the truth of their spending cuts.

Speaking to party activists and supporters in Glasgow, she said that non protected spending including schools, transport and legal aid faced cuts of 16% over the next Parliament, following a cut of 5.4% in last week's budget.

Labour would use the new powers of the Scottish Parliament to ""break with Tory austerity"" and ensure that the education budget is protected over the lifetime of the next Parliament.

Kezia said:
""The debate on tax that began with our alternative to this austerity budget hasn't gone away. In fact, it is only just beginning. Why? Because with agreement on new powers no party seeking office can ignore the big choice at this election: Are we going to accept the billions of pounds of cuts to come or are we going to use the powers?

""As their own spending plans stand, with the new powers the Scottish Parliament is now guaranteed, the SNP would make cuts of £2.2billion to non-protected departments by 2020.

""We have challenged the SNP again and again on why it is that the NHS, police and small business support are guaranteed to be protected from cuts in their spending plans for the next 5 years but education, we have now confirmed in a parliamentary vote, is not.

""Fiscal analysis by IPPR Scotland shows that this means cuts of 16% to those areas not protected. To put this in context, the austerity budget just passed by the SNP cut those areas by 5.4%.

""Let me be clear, because our opponents will use any ambiguity to distract from the big questions they must answer: our argument is not that those priorities the SNP set out should not be protected. We would also protect NHS spending in real terms over the next parliament, for example. What we are saying is that cuts of this scale to transport, legal aid, the environment, culture, universities, skills, and above all, schools, are simply unacceptable.

""We must prioritise education because our nation's economic prosperity depends on it. We cannot compete on low skills and low wages. On productivity the UK still ranks in the bottom half of industrialised nations – and Scotland lags behind the UK. We risk being left further behind in the global economic race. Improving productivity is an urgent national need.

""We simply cannot go on cutting education and skills ever more deeply. In my last speech I pointed out that education has been cut by the SNP. The First Minister has vehemently denied this when I confronted her at First Minister's Questions about it. But look at the facts.

""The official figures show that local education budgets have been cut in every year since the SNP was re-elected.

""By £272 million in 11/12, then by £100 million, then £147 million and £20 million. A total real terms cut to local education of around half a billion pounds since Nicola Sturgeon was re-elected.

""That is why we have been so strong, not just in arguing for additional resources, but in arguing for the ways in which these resources can be generated.

""Without significant new revenues, which the SNP have yet to identify, a re-elected SNP would be faced with a stark choice: cut education again and again or cut those other departments by huge amounts.

""If they do plan to protect education, despite voting against it in parliament this month, then you would expect to see honest plans set out by Ministers in other departments for completely reassessing what they are able to deliver as their budgets are cut by hundreds of millions. But you don't. There is total silence about the scale of cuts to come.

""It isn't just that avoiding this truth before an election is dishonest, it is a dereliction of duty by the government.

""In our new powerful Scotland we can do things differently, we should do things differently and we must.

""We would break from the austerity of the Tories and pursue a different economic vision based on investment in education, skills and raising productivity.""

→ Nicola Sturgeon is planning to give the green light to fracking if she is re-elected in May.
→ Kezia challenged her to back her pledge to ban fracking in Scotland.
→ Despite the SNP campaigning on an anti-fracking platform last May, Nicola Sturgeon refused to back Labour's pledge.

The SNP are only committed to a temporary freeze on fracking, not an outright ban, and have commissioned major research on how to clean up after fracking.

The SNP are also not releasing minutes of meetings with business who stand to gain millions from fracking in Scotland.

Minutes before FMQs, SNP Energy Minister Fergus Ewing said the SNP Government's current approach is to pursue fracking based on evidence and no conclusions had been reached.

Kez said:
""The SNP say fracking is bad. They have imposed a temporary freeze. A big report has been ordered. But it looks like they are going to go ahead and do it anyway. 

""All across the country SNP candidates are telling voters that there will be no fracking under the SNP. The same people who promised Scots they'd scrap the council tax.

""Scottish Labour will go into the election with a very clear manifesto commitment. We will oppose fracking.

Today, after ten years of attacking the council tax, the SNP government have simply decided to keep it whilst announcing changes to existing banding.

In the long term, the SNP need to deliver more clarity on the assignation of income tax to local authorities, with serious questions over whether the proposals are fair.

He said:
 
""With the devolution of social security we have a real opportunity to do things differently.
 
""A strong foundation is vital to the creation of any new system but what is more important is what is built on top those foundations and how any new system is financed.
 
""We want to see child poverty at the centre of any system. One in four children in Scotland are affected by poverty – 220,000 of our fellow citizens. That is a collective shame that none of us can wash our hands of.
 
""We want to lift children out of poverty, so we will stop SNP cuts to schools and use social security powers to make life better for families.
 
""Scottish Labour will offer children leaving care and going into higher education a full grant, giving them the best opportunity to complete their studies and move on in life.
 
""We will raise the level of Carer's Allowance to match the level of Jobseeker's Allowance, and we will more than double the level of maternity grant to £1,030, helping struggling mums with the cost of a new baby.
 
""We will also use the new powers to formally abolish the Tory bedroom tax in Scotland.
 
""Until the SNP show how they will pay for the extra things they say they want to do their plans will lack any credibility.""

Kezia said that non protected spending including schools, transport and legal aid faced cuts of 16% over the next Parliament, following a cut of 5.4% in last week's budget.

Labour would use the new powers of the Scottish Parliament to ""break with Tory austerity"" and ensure that the education budget is protected over the lifetime of the next Parliament.

Here's some of what Kezia said - you can read the full speech over on our blog: 

""We have challenged the SNP again and again on why it is that the NHS, police and small business support are guaranteed to be protected from cuts in their spending plans for the next 5 years but education, we have now confirmed in a parliamentary vote, is not.

""Fiscal analysis by IPPR Scotland shows that this means cuts of 16% to those areas not protected. To put this in context, the austerity budget just passed by the SNP cut those areas by 5.4%. 

""Let me be clear, because our opponents will use any ambiguity to distract from the big questions they must answer: our argument is not that those priorities the SNP set out should not be protected. We would also protect NHS spending in real terms over the next parliament, for example. What we are saying is that cuts of this scale to transport, legal aid, the environment, culture, universities, skills, and above all, schools, are simply unacceptable.

""We must prioritise education because our nation's economic prosperity depends on it. We cannot compete on low skills and low wages. On productivity the UK still ranks in the bottom half of industrialised nations – and Scotland lags behind the UK. We risk being left further behind in the global economic race. Improving productivity is an urgent national need. 

""Without significant new revenues, which the SNP have yet to identify, a re-elected SNP would be faced with a stark choice: cut education again and again or cut those other departments by huge amounts. 

""If they do plan to protect education, despite voting against it in parliament this month, then you would expect to see honest plans set out by Ministers in other departments for completely reassessing what they are able to deliver as their budgets are cut by hundreds of millions. But you don't. There is total silence about the scale of cuts to come.

""It isn't just that avoiding this truth before an election is dishonest, it is a dereliction of duty by the government. 

""In our new powerful Scotland we can do things differently, we should do things differently and we must.""

New analysis has found that 580,919 days were lost to delayed discharge in 2015. Delayed discharge is when a patient is clinically ready to be released from hospital but isn't. 

A year ago SNP Health Minister Shona Robison pledged to eradicate delayed discharge by the end of the year, and gave a personal commitment to deal with delayed discharge in the 2014 Programme for Government when she was first appointed Health Minister.

The figure shows the failure of the SNP's crisis management approach to our NHS, and warned that hundreds of millions of pounds of cuts to public services in the SNP budget will increase the strain on our hospitals. 

Our Public Services spokesperson Dr Richard Simpson, a former GP with thirty years' experience, said:   

""SNP Health Minister Shona Robison promised to eradicate delayed discharge from our health service. That promise hasn't just been broken, it has been smashed to pieces. 

""More than half a million bed days lost to delayed discharge is nothing other than complete and utter failure from a SNP Government who promised to get rid of the problem completely. 

""This goes to the heart of the SNP's crisis management of our NHS. Failing to deal with delayed discharge means that fewer patients have the dignity of receiving care in their homes and the queues at A&E get longer, which increases pressure on NHS staff. 

""The hundreds of millions of pounds of cuts in the SNP budget will only increase the strain on our NHS. 

""Cuts to the councils that provide care and other services to vulnerable Scots is a completely short-sighted way to handle our health and care service. 

""These cuts aren't necessary. Instead we can use the powers of the Scottish Parliament to make different tax choices from the SNP and Tories so we can invest in the future. Investing will stop the cuts and give our NHS, established in the 1940s, the tools and resources it needs to deal with the challenges of the 2040s.""

The plummeting oil price has had a traumatic impact on the economy of the North East.

Kez said: 
""I was born in Aberdeen and as a student at the University of Aberdeen I spent my summers packing food boxes for the oil rigs offshore and working in local bars and cafes. 

""I know from personal experience just how important the oil industry is, not just for those who work directly in the oil and gas business but also for those in the supply chain and the local community.

""Thousands of jobs have been lost and firms have gone out of business. This is one of the toughest times the oil and gas industry has ever faced. The new analysis produced today by the independent experts at the Scottish Parliament paints a stark picture of the devastating toll the oil price crash has taken on the area.

""Despite that, there can still be a bright future for the industry and for the North East as a whole. With the right government support, the investment can return and jobs can be saved.

""The UK Government's Budget will be announced in a few weeks time. I want the Chancellor to use his Budget as an opportunity to demonstrate confidence in the long term future of the oil and gas industry by stepping up and playing his part.

""Whether that's through the fiscal regime to attract greater investment or in support for developing what could be a thriving decommissioning industry, there is a responsibility on the UK Government to act.

""The SNP Government must do much more too. Their response to the current problems in the oil industry began at a snail's pace, because to acknowledge the scale of the challenges here was too politically inconvenient. Eventually support to help people back into work was launched, but it has fallen far short of what is needed.

Yesterday the Deputy First Minister John Swinney said claims about job losses have been ""utterly exaggerated"". Trade unions have said that thousands of jobs will be lost because of the SNP's budget cuts for next year.

At First Minister's Questions today Nicola Sturgeon was asked by Kezia to set out how many jobs will be lost as a result of the SNP's budget. The First Minister refused to do so.

We produced a plan during the budget process to set a Scottish rate of Income Tax 1p higher than the rate set by George Osborne. 

This would have increased the Scottish Government's budget by more than £100 million for 2016/17 and stopped the SNP's cuts to schools and other vital public services. The SNP and the Tories stood shoulder to shoulder to vote against this plan and for more cuts.

Here's what Kezia has said:
""The casual disregard with which John Swinney dismissed those who are losing their jobs left many workers sick to their stomach. To hear Nicola Sturgeon join in the attack on trade unions today is even worse.

""Despite the pretence from the government, the reality is that cuts are happening all across the country because of a choice the SNP made. Teachers, classroom assistants and office staff find themselves out of work because of choices the SNP have made.

""Nicola Sturgeon should come clean about how many jobs will be lost as a result of her cuts.

""With the budget we were faced with a choice between using the powers of this Parliament to invest in the future or imposing more cuts to vital public services. Yet when Nicola Sturgeon had the chance to use the powers to stop cuts to schools and save jobs she bottled it with her austerity budget.""

""I welcome the news that an agreement has been reached on the fiscal framework. This is a historic moment for Scotland and one that we should all celebrate.

""Scottish Labour's position has been clear all along – we would only support a deal that protected the Barnett formula which has benefited generations of Scots. It appears that this deal does exactly that and has our support.

""Now that an agreement has been reached every single political party in Scotland must focus on what we can do with these major new powers. The opportunities they provide are huge – we can use the new tax and welfare powers to bring an end to Tory austerity and build a fairer country.

""I want to use the new tax powers to make fairer choices. That means we can ask the richest few to pay a little bit more so we can invest in education and help first time buyers double their deposit by not implementing the SNP's planned airline ticket tax cut.

""Scottish Labour has already transformed the debate in Scottish politics by setting out our bold plan to set a Scottish rate of Income Tax 1p higher than that set by George Osborne so we can stop the cuts to schools and other vital public services. Faced with a choice between using the powers of our Parliament to invest in the future or carrying on with the SNP's cuts to schools, we choose to use the powers.

""Scottish politics will never be the same again thanks to these new powers. We have entered a new and exciting era of devolution.""

It's clear our plans are fair - new expert evidence from the impartial experts at the Scottish Parliament published at the weekend confirmed that 92% of the tax increase would be paid for by households in the top half of earners. 

This is one reason why experts like IPPR Scotland and the Resolution Foundation, as well as trade unionists across the country, agree our plan is fair. 

Those income taxpayers earning less than £20,000 a year won't pay a single penny more, and many of them will end up better off as a result of our plan for a £100 payment.

The SNP plan on cutting hundreds of millions of pounds from education and other essential public services that we all rely on so that people on six figure salaries don't have to pay a bit more in tax. That's just not fair.

We'll be gathering outside the Scottish Parliament at 1pm on Wednesday to ask MSPs to vote against the SNP's cuts.

310039442421596_989847851107415,"BREAKING: New expert evidence has again confirmed that setting a Scottish rate of Income Tax 1p higher than that set by George Osborne is fair.

Ahead of the final vote on the Budget in the Scottish Parliament on Wednesday, new analysis by the independent experts at the Scottish Parliament Information Centre (SPICe) shows that under Labour's plan around two-thirds (64%) of the increase would be paid by richest 20% of households. The SPICe analysis also confirms that if a Scottish rate of Income Tax was set 1p higher, 92% of the increase would be paid by households in the top half of earners.

Households in the bottom half of earners in Scotland would pay less than 10% of the increase. However, under Labour's plan those income taxpayers earning less than £20,000 a year – including pensioners - would receive an annual £100 payment to ensure they did not pay a single penny more. Many income taxpayers earning less than £20,000 a year would end up better off thanks to this payment.

The SNP's Budget for 2016/17 is set to cuts hundreds of millions of pounds from schools and other vital public services. Under plans set out by Labour these cuts could be avoided and education spending protected in real terms over the next five years. The SNP stood shoulder to shoulder with the Tories to vote for cuts to schools and against protecting education spending in real terms.

Separate analysis by the experts at SPICe confirms that unprotected areas – including education – could face cuts of 16% over the next five years under the SNP's plans. That would mean cuts to local authority education budgets worth almost £800 million a year by 2019/20.

Kezia has said:

""This new expert evidence proves beyond all doubt once and for all that Labour's plan to set a Scottish rate of Income Tax just 1p higher than that set by George Osborne is fair. The fact that 92% of the cost of this plan would be paid for by the top half of earners in Scotland shows that it is the right thing to do.

""The SNP are planning on cutting hundreds of millions of pounds from education and other essential public services so that people on six figure salaries don't have to pay a bit more in tax. That's just not fair. I won't put the future success of our young people and our nation at risk like that.

""We know the SNP have stood shoulder to shoulder with the Tories to oppose Labour's plan to stop the cuts to schools and protect the education budget. When the Budget returns to the Scottish Parliament for its final vote on Wednesday the SNP should examine their consciences and do the right thing for the sake of Scotland's young people.  

""The Scottish Parliament has the powers now to bring an end to the cuts. We can make different choices from those of George Osborne. Faced with the choice between using the powers of our Parliament to invest in the future prosperity of our country or cutting the budget for schools and other services, we choose to use the powers.

""If the SNP vote for these hundreds of millions of pounds of cuts to schools and other public services on Wednesday they will be selling out the people of Scotland.""

They can choose to reverse their plan for hundreds of millions of pounds of cuts to schools and other public services by voting for a 1p Income Tax increase. 

Under plans set out by Kezia, we believe the rate should be set 1p higher than that set by George Osborne. 

This would raise half a billion pounds and would avoid cuts to schools and other vital public services.

The SNP's Budget for 2016/17 imposes cuts worth hundreds of millions of pounds, that would see spending on education and other public services fall. 

Experts – including Professors David Bell and David Eiser of Stirling University; the Resolution Foundation; and IPPR Scotland – have confirmed Labour's plan is fair, as have trade unions. 

Council leaders across Scotland have also backed Scottish Labour's plan to make a £100 payment to taxpayers – including pensioners – earning less than £20,000 to ensure they don't pay a single penny more. Many of the taxpayers earning less than £20,000 would actually be better off overall under this plan. 

Last week in the Scottish Parliament the SNP and the Tories stood 'shoulder to shoulder' to vote against Labour's tax plan that would have stopped cuts to education. 

Faced with the choice between using our powers to invest in the future of our country or backing the SNP's cuts to schools and other public services, we choose to use our powers. 

Scottish Labour would protect education spending in real terms for the next five years, so we can give our young people the skills they need to compete for the jobs of the future. We can only grow our economy and help our businesses to thrive in the future if we invest in education now. 

Politics in Scotland has changed dramatically in the last few days. Claiming to be against cuts but refusing to do anything about them is no longer acceptable. 

All SNP MSPs who have campaigned against cuts for years should do the right thing and back Labour's plan.

We would set the Scottish rate of income tax 1 penny higher than the rate set by George Osborne to stop cuts to schools and local services.

This is another expert group confirming that this is a fair way to stop hundreds of millions of cuts to our local services.

Ahead of another key vote on the Scottish rate of income tax this week the SNP has been left with no credible excuse for opposing Labour's plans to stop the cuts to education and local services.

Faced with the choice between using the powers of the Scottish Parliament and cuts to our children's future, we choose to use the powers and stop the cuts.

The SNP find themselves on the same side of the argument as the Tories, endorsing George Osborne's tax plans when we can make different, and fairer, choices now.

As the deadline for Scottish Councils to sign up to the SNP Government's deal of hundreds of millions of pounds of cuts to schools and local services looms, Kez will visit a nursery the First Minister has previously visited to promote her childcare promises.

The SNP budget includes a 57% cut to council budgets to build the new nurseries needed to meet the SNP's childcare pledge to provide 600 hours of free childcare a year. 

Kez has said:

""Nicola Sturgeon made a clear promise to families across Scotland – she would stand up against austerity and invest in the future.

""Instead today she will force councils across Scotland to sign up to hundreds of millions of pounds of cuts or face sanctions of hundreds of millions more.

""Those cuts will be devastating to schools and children services across Scotland. Rather than delivering Nicola Sturgeon's promises on childcare her budget will slash investment in our children's future.

""The SNP's childcare plans require hundreds of new nurseries to be built across Scotland but the SNP budget slashes the funding to build those nurseries more than 50%.

""Faced with the choice between huge cuts to schools and local services or using the powers of the Scottish Parliament Labour would use the powers to stop the cuts.

""We would set the Scottish rate of income tax 1 penny higher than George Osborne and raise hundreds of millions more to invest in the future of our children and the future of our country.""

Investing in childcare isn't a social policy – it's a key economic policy for the next decade.

Childcare is a huge cost for families across the country, but cutting the budgets to deliver more flexible and accessible childcare is not going to help anyone.

Faced with that choice between cuts that will short-change families or using the powers of the Scottish parliament we would use the powers of the Scottish Parliament.

Here's what happened today:
Speaking at First Minister's Questions, Kezia said the SNP's vote against her plan to use the powers of the Scottish Parliament to stop cuts means they have been found out.

Earlier this week Kezia set out a plan to set the Scottish rate of income tax 1p higher than that set by George Osborne.

This would mean the hundreds of millions of pounds of cuts proposed by the SNP Government's budget for 2016/17 could be avoided.

To ensure low income taxpayers receive a boost, a £100 payment would be introduced for those earning less than £20,000. This would be administered by local authorities. Council leaders across Scotland have confirmed this is possible.

Experts and trade unions have also said using the income tax power is a progressive measure as the richest would pay the most. 

Even SNP Minister John Swinney has previously described it as progressive.

Yesterday, the SNP and the Tories stood 'shoulder to shoulder' to vote against Labour's plan to stop the cuts.

Here's what Kezia has said:
""Nicola Sturgeon has built her career on telling us that more powers mean fewer cuts, yet she refuses to use the powers when it really matters. She has staked her reputation on improving education, yet she cuts school budgets rather than using the powers of the Scottish Parliament.

""Nicola Sturgeon has sold herself as the radical alternative to Tory austerity, but yesterday she sold out the people who need her most.

""At the stroke of a pen the First Minister could stop the hundreds of millions of pounds worth of cuts and thousands of job losses, but faced with the choice between using the powers of this Parliament and hundreds of millions of pounds of cuts she chose austerity.

""After this week people across Scotland are left asking why Nicola Sturgeon won't just use her power to do the right thing.""

It enables us to stop cuts to schools and other vital public services, and to guarantee that spending on education will be protected in real terms in the next five years.

To make sure that the lowest paid workers don't lose out, we would introduce a new payment of £100 to those working taxpayers earning less than £20,000 a year, administered through local councils. Under our plan up to 810,000 workers would either be unaffected or actually be better off. 
 
Income tax is a progressive measure, since the wealthiest will pay the most. Under our tax and rebate plan, someone on the living wage would be £51 a year better off. A worker earning £30,000 a year would only pay £3.65 a week extra, I will pay an extra £40 a month and someone earning the same £144,687 salary as the First Minister would pay an extra £1,447 a year.

Protecting the spending for our schools, colleges and universities is the way to cut the gap between the richest and the rest and give our young people the skills they need to access the jobs of tomorrow.

Nicola Sturgeon has said that education is her top priority – but her budget doesn't reflect that. She is proposing hundreds of millions of pounds worth of cuts to local services, which will hammer education budgets up and down Scotland.

The SNP Government in Edinburgh have pledged to protect health and police budgets, but not the spending on our schools for young people.

Funding education has to be a national priority again. Cuts made by the SNP to local education funding over the last nine years are already hurting our children's schools.

Cuts to education undermine the economic potential of our nation. 

The choice facing voters in the election is now clear - we can use the new powers to invest in our young people with Labour, or keep cutting school budgets with the SNP.

Scottish politics is changing. It's no longer good enough to say you are against cuts but do nothing to change things.

- The children's ward at St John's Hospital in Livingston
- Emergency care at the Vale of Leven Hospital
- The children's ward at the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley

""The Holocaust ended in the 'final solution' but it began with everyday abuse and assaults targeted at Jewish people simply because of their religion. This year the theme of Holocaust Memorial Day is 'Don't Stand By'. It is a reminder to people that great hate can grow from the small acts of unkindness and injustice we witness in our everyday lives and that we all have a responsibility to stand up to them.""

""It is right that each year we stop to remember those who were killed in the Holocaust and subsequent genocides. Today I will join survivors from across the UK as they remember their family, friends and loved ones who were murdered because of hate and intolerance.

The SNP budget will impose cuts of half a billion pounds next year alone, and the Tories want to cut even deeper with their tax plans.

We need to invest in our young people, not pull the rug out from under them. 

Our plan for a Fair Start Fund would target extra resources for our primary schools and nurseries, giving teachers real power to make a difference. 

If we want to create a better future for our country then somebody has to pay for it, and we are determined that it won't be Scotland's children. 

Under our plan the richest few earning more than £150,000 would pay more in tax so we can invest in our schools and nurseries. That's the fair thing to do.

310039442421596_974367162655484,"Our radical plan on housing will support nearly 50,000 jobs a year and help thousands of first-time buyers. 

Our analysis suggests that by the end of the next parliament around 17,200 first-time buyer purchases a year will benefit from our plan. 

The number of people helped will be higher as the majority will be couples buying their first home – both will receive help under Scottish Labour's plan.

This week the SNP government announced plans to cut the Help to Buy scheme.

Under the SNP Government, the number of people in Scotland aged 34 and younger who have bought their own home with a mortgage has fallen by 15%. Just 28% of those aged 16-34 in Scotland now own their home with a mortgage – the lowest level since the Scottish Parliament was established in 1999.

Labour will also take action to ban rip off rent rises in the private sector.

Today hundreds of activists across the country will take to the streets for our first big national campaign day of the year, with 45 campaign events in every region of Scotland launching a new leaflet outlining the party's radical housing plan.

Deputy Leader Alex Rowley said:

""Everybody deserves a home and a chance, but whether you are a private renter, a social tenant or looking to buy for the first time it has been a difficult few years.

""Getting it right on housing can be the key that unlocks so much opportunity for our country; we can tackle poverty and grow the economy by building more homes. New analysis shows that our plan to build 60,000 homes over the next five years will sustain thousands of jobs.

""The SNP Government in Edinburgh have turned a housing shortage into a housing crisis. Scotland has more than 150,000 people on social waiting lists, an unacceptable amount of private tenants living in poverty, whilst three quarters of non-owners feel they will never own a home. 

""That's why Scottish Labour is promising bold and radical action in every area ofr housing. We'll help first time buyers save towards a deposit with £3,000 of extra support for those who put a little aside every month.

""A whole generation of young people have been left behind by austerity and Labour will give them a chance to get on in life. So many young people in Scotland are stuck in a cycle from which they can't escape. They end up renting to save for a deposit, but the rent is so high they simply can't put enough money away. No wonder more than half see the size of a deposit as a barrier to owning a home.

""For those living in the private rented sector we'll ban rip off rent rises to stop bad landlords hitting tenants with unfair rent hikes.

""We'll build a minimum of 60,000 affordable homes over the next five years, 45,000 of which will be council or housing association homes. That's the figure that industry experts tell us we should be aiming for and it will begin to tackle Scotland's housing crisis.

""After nearly a decade in office and a majority in parliament the SNP have been managerial on housing. Labour's bold housing plan would build a fairer nation and a stronger Scotland.""

Nicola Sturgeon's own poverty advisor has rightly said that affordable, flexible childcare is key to helping people out of poverty. 

The SNP's solution to the problems with childcare in Scotland is to slash the budgets for childcare and local services. Only in the world of the SNP will that deliver a childcare revolution. 

Kez revealed how the SNP's childcare plan is just a big con. She highlighted: 

→ SNP Government cuts to council funding to deliver on Nicola Sturgeon's pledge to provide 600 hours of free childcare a year
→ Figures which confirm that allocations to councils to deliver on the SNP's childcare pledge has fallen by £10.5 million (5.3%).
→ This includes a cut to the capital budget for nurseries of 57%. 

Despite not meeting existing pledges, Nicola Sturgeon has promised every child 1140 hours of free childcare by 2020. 

The campaign group Fair Funding For Our Kids has confirmed this would require the equivalent of 650 new nurseries to be built, and mean allocation for an extra 26,000 children. 

Kez said today that the SNP's plan to deliver this isn't credible because they are cutting half a billion pounds from local services in the next year alone.

TO LOCAL GOVERNMENT →
The SNP plan to cut more than £500 million from local government in the budget. COSLA estimate this would result in 15,000 job losses. 

The cuts to local services such as schools are short-sighted, and would hinder Scotland's ability to give our young people the skills we need for the jobs of the future. 

Despite this, the SNP Government have denied any such cut is happening. 

In Scotland we have the chance to reject austerity and present the real change which people across Scotland are crying out for. Instead the SNP Government plan to accept Tory austerity. 

It's not credible for the First Minister to claim education is her top priority whilst simultaneously slashing local education budgets. This will have a devastating impact on our future economy if our young people are not equipped with the right skills.

We've also revealed that the SNP plan to cut the fuel poverty budget by 13%, a cut which has since been confirmed by the independent experts at the Scottish Parliament Information Centre.

310039442421596_969501993142001,"New expert evidence shows Scottish education is narrowing as the attainment gap is widening

Following on from reports that the attainment gap had grown in 2015, we today published an expert submission made by Dr Jim Scott of the University of Dundee to the OECD review of Curriculum for Excellence which shows: 

→ Enrolment in National 3-5 subjects has dropped by 17% since the introduction of Curriculum for Excellence, meaning pupils are doing fewer subjects
→ Overall attainment in these subjects has dropped by 24%.
→ Both enrolment and attainment in Modern Languages is in steep decline, to the point where some subjects may no longer be viable in Scotland 

Dr Scott says ""this compounds Scotland's existing problems of social justice and equality of opportunity."" 

Scottish education used to be the best in the world. It should be again, with every young person getting the best possible start in life to access the jobs of tomorrow. 

One of the key strengths of the Scottish education system has always been the breadth of its curriculum. After a decade of the SNP Government in charge of our schools we are seeing Scottish education narrowing, attainment falling and some subjects are at risk of disappearing altogether. 

We warned the SNP about these problems months ago and they dismissed our evidence. Today we see that those trends have continued into the second year of the new exams. 

Nicola Sturgeon said education was her number one priority as First Minister, but after more than a year in the job we are seeing the attainment gap widening and the breadth of subjects our students are successful at narrowing. 

The First Minister can announce frameworks and testing all she likes but the reality is that we won't close the attainment gap without the proper resources. 

That's why Scottish Labour would ask those lucky enough to earn more than £150,000 a year to be a little extra to establish a Fair Start Fund. That would mean £1,000 of extra funding for every pupil in our schools from a poorer background.

Last month the SNP Finance Minister John Swinney published his draft budget, which included a reduction in the amount of money spent on fuel poverty.
 
The independent experts at the Scottish Parliament Information Centre (Spice) have confirmed that the final fuel poverty budget for 2015/16 was £119 million. This is due to fall by £15 million in 2016/17 under the SNP's plans - a cut of 13%.
 
Under the last Labour-led Scottish Government, the Scottish Parliament passed a law to set a target to eradicate fuel poverty by 2016.
 
This target will not be met. Under the SNP, the latest figures for 2014 show no real change from the previous year with just under 35% of households in Scotland in fuel poverty.

MSPs will soon debate the Transplantation (Authorisation of Removal of Organs etc.) (Scotland) Bill.

The private members bill from Scottish Labour MSP Anne McTaggart would introduce a ""soft opt-out"" system to Scotland which would permit the removal of organs unless the person objected during their lifetime.

The Welsh Labour Government introduced a soft opt-out system in December 2015.

The SNP should have a change of heart over their plans to delay any changes to the organ donor system in Scotland.

Evidence suggests that a move to a soft opt-out system could increase donation rates by up to 30%.

The Scottish Parliament has taken bold and radical action on health policy before, like the smoking ban. 

We need an NHS fit for the 2040s, not the 1940s. That means taking decisions for the long-term, like introducing a soft opt-out system for organ donations.

On Tuesday we unveiled the party's first manifesto pledge for the Scottish Parliament election in May, which would take bold action to help first time buyers get on the property ladder.
 
The Halifax report confirms that the average non-owner in Scotland only saves £25 a week, the lowest figure across the UK.
 
Under our plan, those saving through the first-time buyer ISA scheme could effectively have their savings doubled. A person who currently saves through a first-time buyer ISA will receive a 25% top up from the UK government, up to the value of £3,000.

She highlighted the following statistics:
→ Under the SNP just 28% of those aged 16-34 own their home. That has fallen from 48% in 1999
→ 41% of people aged 16-34 in Scotland live in private rented accommodation, an increase from just 13% in 1999
→ It would take a couple with an average household income 10 years to save for a £15,000 deposit.

Earlier this week Kez set out a bold plan to help first time buyers.

Our plan would effectively double the help first time buyers currently receive towards saving for a deposit.

Kez said:
""Owning their own home is a key ambition for many young Scots, but for thousands of people from my generation it's just not a realistic prospect. 

""So many of our young people are stuck in a cycle from which there is little escape – they rent to save for a deposit, but the rent is so high they simply can't put enough money away. It's generation rent.

""Labour has a plan to help young people get on in life. We would encourage people to put money away if they can and in return we would help them get on the property ladder.

""Young people in Scotland are getting a raw deal under the SNP Government. They are bearing the brunt of an austerity agenda Nicola Sturgeon seems content to manage rather than change. 

""Instead of investing in their own future the hard earned cash of thousands of young people is boosting the profits of private landlords.

""Politics is all about making choices. Labour would spend money to help young people get on in life, whereas Nicola Sturgeon would rather spend that same money on a tax cut to help big airlines. 

""It's clear that whilst we are on the side of young people with ambition, the SNP are on the side of big airlines.""

""In addition to the power over the NHS, education, skills, transport, rural affairs, economic development, justice and policing, new powers over tax, borrowing and welfare will be in our hands.

""For the past three years at this time political leaders in Scotland have said that the following twelve months will be crucial to the future of our country. We all said it ahead of the referendum and then the General Election, and we will say it again this year. Repeating that message doesn't make it any less true.

""The election in May will be the most significant since devolution in 1999. With the major new tax and spending powers coming to the Scottish Parliament, the question won't be which politicians do voters want to allocate a big pot of money. For the first time each political party will have to say where the money they want to spend is coming from. The New Year will bring a new era in Scottish politics.

""The rules of the game are changing on Scottish politics. Saying you are for something but refusing to do anything about it just won't wash anymore. Those of us who say we are against Tory austerity will have to prove it with the decisions we take. Managing austerity isn't good enough when we will have the powers to take a different path.

""Scottish Labour has led the way by setting out how we would do things differently on tax from the Tories and the SNP. We would ask those earning more than £150,000 a year to pay a little extra in tax so we can invest in education - both the Tories and the SNP oppose this. We wouldn't follow the SNP to spend £250 million to cut the price of an airline ticket, and we don't support the Tory tax cut for higher earners.

""The differences between the parties will be clearer than ever at the election. Whilst the other parties are content to manage austerity, only Scottish Labour are bold enough and honest enough to set out the change that is needed and how we would make that happen.

""I look forward to 2016 with hope and optimism, both for the future of my party and my country. I am hopeful that the public will get the election they deserve. I believe it will be an election focused not on the constitution - even Nicola Sturgeon has said the vote won't be about another referendum - but on using the major new powers coming to Scotland to transform our nation.

""As we head into 2016 I want to wish everybody across the country a very happy and peaceful New Year.""

Delayed discharge is when a patient is clinically ready to be released from hospital but isn't.
 
Official figures published this week show that over 50,000 bed days were occupied by delayed discharge patients in October 2015.
 
Information available for the year shows that nearly 500,000 bed days have been lost this year to delayed discharge.  
 
In February SNP Health Minister Shona Robison pledged to eradicate delayed discharge by the end of the year, and gave a personal commitment to deal with delayed discharge in the 2014 programme for government when she was first appointed Health Minister.

As we head into winter these problems are only likely to get worse. We've called for greater investment in social care in the Scottish budget and whilst we welcome extra funding it shouldn't have taken nine years for the SNP to see the solution. The SNP voting against a living wage for care workers shows how short sighted they still are about health and social care.
 
We should be investing in our NHS for the long term to build a health service fit for the challenges of the  2040s, not the 1940s. A year on in the job, Shona Robison hasn't delivered.

It's a strategic asset that's at the heart of the transport infrastructure for the whole country. Thousands of people rely on it to get to and from their work every day and businesses depend on it for getting their goods and services to their customers.

In #FMQs today, Kez told the SNP that instead of trying to avoid blame, they should accept responsibility for the bridge closure 

She highlighted: 

- Minutes from a Forth Estuary Transport Authority (FETA) meeting in October 2013, which confirmed that a number of key bridge capital projects were ""deferred"" because of a lack of funding
- The SNP Government have cut the bridge budget by 65% since 2008 

On Tuesday SNP Transport Minister Derek Mackay said there was no link between cancelled repair works in 2010 and the bridge closure. However, on Wednesday Mr Mackay admitted that there was a link. He was recalled to Parliament to make a statement clarifying his remarks, however this only raised even further questions. 

Kez also called on the First Minister to confirm that small vans could drive along the priority route, currently reserved for buses and HGV lorries, to help small businesses struggling because of the closure. 

Nicola Sturgeon failed to confirm any details.

Under the SNP the Forth Road Bridge has suffered from budget cuts, the privatisation of services and cancelled repairs. Instead of constantly trying to avoid the blame, it's time for the SNP Government to accept responsibility.

→ Ensuring they are paid for travel cost & time
→ No zero hour contracts
→ Appropriate training for staff

Labour led Renfrewshire Council has already implemented these key targets and service users and staff are seeing the benefits with improved productivity and reduced staff turnover.
 
We'd work with local authorities, the health sector and private providers to ensure a national guarantee for care workers on terms and conditions.
 
We have to face the challenges of social care head on, so we can have a health service fit for the 2040s, not the 1940s. This is about raising standards in the industry so those who receive care get better quality care.
 
Our NHS will feel the benefit too. A motivated professional care workforce supported by real investment will keep  more patients out of hospital, giving them the dignity of care in their own home and relieving the pressure on our hospitals.
 
After eight years of excuses from the SNP Government, is time to end the sticking plaster approach to our health service and get serious about social care as a vital part of a sustainable NHS for the long term.

Speaking ahead of the debate, she said:

""Each year of inaction will see up to 3500 Scots each die from respiratory and coronary diseases as a result. Air quality is not just an environmental priority, it is a moral and public health issue which the SNP Government is failing on.

""This debate comes just weeks after the SNP Government's Cleaner Air Strategy paid lip service to the problem and kicked the issue into the long grass. They want to take 3 years to 'redesign the wheel' while they mull over the implementation of Low Emissions Zones.

""With thousands of potential deaths caused by its inaction, today I'll call on the SNP Government to conduct a Health Impact Assessment of its strategy.  

""Scotland and the UK are lagging behind Europe and Asia on Low Emissions Zones, selling Dennis' electric buses to the Chinese, while Minsters take chauffeur driven journeys up the Royal Mile.

310039442421596_940962725995928,"Kezia Dugdale visited pupils at Dumbarton Academy with Public Services Spokesperson Jackie Baillie this morning.

There, Kez spoke about how a government must be judged by the level of support it offers the most disadvantaged people in our society. In 2013/14 just 156 young people who were in care went on to higher education. We will change that. Kez has announced that a Scottish Labour Government will award student grant support of £6,000 a year to anybody who comes from care and manages to fight their way to higher education.

This is what Kez had to say ahead of her visit to Dumbarton Academy: 

""A government must be judged by how it supports the most disadvantaged people in our society, and they don't come much more disadvantaged than young people in care. We need to close the gap between the richest and the rest, so that care leavers can have as many opportunities to get on in life as any other young person.

""Too often we simply forget about them. Not necessarily out of malice or intent, but because they don't have enough people to speak up on their behalf. Whether because of neglect or circumstance, these are young people who grow up without the support network other talented young people take for granted, through no fault of their own.

""The reality is that young care leavers are more likely to go to jail than university. We need to reverse that trend, and the way to do that is to make it easier for care leavers to go on to higher education.

""Scottish Labour have a plan introduce full grant support, worth £6000 a year, for looked after young people who have the talent to go on to higher education. The SNP Government should use their existing attainment fund to introduce this plan.

""Politics is all about making choices. When we decide how to spend public money we are making clear our priorities. Giving young people the best start in life is my priority.""",Photos from Scottish Labour Party's post,photo,https://www.facebook.com/ScottishLabourParty/photos/a.476899549068917.1073741825.310039442421596/940962425995958/?type=3,2015-11-16 08:31:25,62,12,8,62,0,0,0,0,0

The vote on tax credits will be an important moment in the history of devolution. At long last everybody in Scottish politics is going to have to start talking about the responsibilities they do have, and how they would transform the lives of people in this country. 
 
If the SNP do not vote for this motion to restore the money lost through tax credits, it will confirm once and for all that the politics of grievance is more important to them than helping working families in Scotland.
 
Tax credits work. The UK Labour Government introduced them to support people who go out to work each day and do the best by their families. And a Scottish Labour Government would use the new powers coming to Scotland to restore the money lost through tax credits if George Osborne goes ahead with his plan to cut them.
 
We know the powers to restore the money lost through tax credits are coming and we know the money is there to fund them if people are willing to make difficult choices. 
 
Scottish Labour has been very clear about the choices we would make - we would not carry out the SNP's plan for a tax cut for airline operators and we wouldn't implement Tory plans for a tax cut for those paying the higher rate.

Public confidence in Scotland's police service is at a real low. Officers and staff work hard every single day to keep us safe, but they are being let down because of decisions made by those at the top and SNP Government ministers. 

People need to know that the police will be there to help when they are needed. That's just not happening at the moment.

A couple of weeks ago we launched a major review of Scotland's policing. This is an opportunity to rebuild public confidence in our police force after a summer of crisis.

This was submitted alongside a raft of other Scottish Labour amendments designed to improve the Scotland Bill including the devolution of more welfare powers and the establishment of a UK-wide Constitutional Convention. 

Full Fiscal Autonomy was a key pledge from the SNP during the General Election. 

If the SNP have confidence in their policy they should have no problem backing an assessment of the impact of full fiscal autonomy on Scotland's finances by an independent expert commission. 

It's time for the SNP to have the courage of their convictions on full fiscal autonomy.

Last week the SNP refused to back our plans to deliver additional investment in education by using a 50p rate of tax. 

The current scandal in attainment is no more the fault of Scotland's teachers than it is our young people. Both have been let down by an SNP Government in Edinburgh who for eight years have had failed to give education the attention it deserves.

The EIS have said that schools and teachers are committed to tackling the impact of poverty on educational attainment - but need the resources to make it happen.

Scottish Labour has a solution. 

We would use the new powers coming to Scotland to ask those who earn the most to pay a little extra to invest in our young people. Its fair taxes to help the poorest kids. 

The SNP have opposed this in the past but faced with their own record, and their new found interest, they should think again.

Labour has a better plan. 
 
Today we launched our women's manifesto setting out our plan to increase the minimum wage for women across Scotland and guarantee a job for young women out of work for more than a year.

A Labour Government will take action to address deep rooted inequality, with mandatory pay reporting, quotas to ensure 50:50 on our public boards and a new £2.3 million fund for women's aid centres across Scotland.

The SNP's manifesto has fallen apart today after the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) exposed the impact of full fiscal responsibility within the UK.
 
In a devastating report, the impartial and independent experts at the IFS said that by the end of the decade the gap in Scotland's finances because of full fiscal responsibility is due to grow to £9.7 billion a year. 

The IFS conclude that ""full fiscal responsibility would likely entail substantial spending cuts or tax rises in Scotland.""
 
The IFS also demolish the SNP's repeated claim that the gap will be filled by increased economic growth and higher onshore receipts.  

Rather than close the gap, the IFS conclude the SNP's proposed tax cuts would ""cost the government money, and widen rather than shrink the fiscal gap, even if they did boost growth.""

And then when the people of Scotland asked who will fight for and lead a Scottish Parliament, it was Donald Dewar who said call on me.

1. The SNP's White Paper promised the referendum was a 'once in a generation' opportunity. But they've refused to rule out re-running it in their manifesto.

2. Just because you try to rename 'full fiscal autonomy' 'full financial responsibility' doesn't change anything. It would still cost Scotland £7.6 billion.

3. This is a 'say one thing do another' manifesto. They claim to support a UK-wide mansion tax, but at the same time have committed to cutting Scotland off from UK-wide taxes. They claim to be against austerity, when full fiscal autonomy would mean £7.6 billion of cuts, extra borrowing or tax increases.
