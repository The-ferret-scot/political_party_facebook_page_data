Momentum grew out of our first campaign for a new kind of politics, to channel its drive and optimism into a movement that can help Labour win power and transform our society. That enthusiasm is already changing our movement and the country's political debate on crucial issues like austerity.

As 2016 draws to a close, I wanted to share some thoughts about how that could be developed further and ask you to share yours.

'The World Transformed' at Labour Party Conference and new techniques to increase participation in Labour, such as the Grassroots Now phone-canvassing website, are exactly the participatory activities Momentum can organise to help secure a Labour government that will rebuild and transform Britain. Let's do it together; Labour's next big campaigning day is on 21 January. I hope you'll join us for it.

This moment in our history is too important for us not to seize it. We must not let internal debate distract from our work that has to be done to help Labour win elections.

Momentum needs to be an organisation fit for purpose - not copying the failed models of the past but bringing fresh ideas to campaigning and organising in communities, helping members be active in the Labour Party and helping secure a Labour government to rebuild and transform Britain.

That's why the Momentum team has drawn up a survey to give every member a direct say in its future.

We are all part of this historic movement. Let's seize this moment together.

Thank you for all that you have done in 2016. I wish you a Merry Christmas, a peaceful holiday period and a happy new year.

In solidarity,

Jeremy Corbyn

This proud internationalist legacy lives on with Cuban health workers playing a significant role in combatting the Ebola outbreak in Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea.

Momentum has launched MxV, an innovative digital democracy platform to enable Momentum members to shape the organisation's purpose, ethics and structures. On Thursday evening, all members received an email from Momentum Digital with details of how to log into MxV to read, submit, comment on, amend, support and composite proposals to be debated at our first National Conference in February and voted on by members.  

Your proposals should seek to answer these questions:

Purpose: Why does Momentum exist?
Ethics: How should we behave?
Structures: How should we make decisions?

Guidelines on the types of proposals that can be submitted can be found here (https://mxv.peoplesmomentum.com/guidelines). Please remember that this is a platform to decide the purpose, ethics and structures of Momentum - not what we believe should be Government policy.

Any member can comment on proposals and indicate their support. The deadline for proposals to be uploaded is 1 January 2017. 

If any Momentum member hasn't received their login details, they should email digital@peoplesmomentum.com.

MxV allows all members of Momentum to participate in the conversation about Momentum's future - from the parent with childcare responsibilities who can't get to political meetings, to the shift-worker who works anti-social hours. Everyone's ideas are valued and should contribute to the debate. 

Whilst this is an online forum, the process of generating ideas and discussion should extend offline. Local Momentum Groups are encouraged to spend some time at their meetings discussing the sort of organisation Momentum needs to be to meet the challenges of world and how we should build it.

The Steering Committee agreed to take steps to ensure all Momentum members are represented fairly on the National Committee.

Previously liberation representatives were elected by small working groups and the 2 seats reserved for women's representatives were vacant. An OMOV election was agreed by the Steering Committee to ensure all members of liberation groups have a say in choosing their representatives.

The National Committee was set up prior to Momentum becoming a membership organisation, and a mapping exercise of our members showed there to be a significant number of members living in areas not covered by a verified local group.

To ensure fair representation of all members on the NC, there are currently OMOV elections in 6 regions for representatives for members that do not live in an area covered by a verified local group.

The National Committee will only be growing by 6 additional seats, which will be filled by the newly elected regional representatives. The election of representatives for each liberation strand (LGBT+/BAME/Women/Disability) is to democratically fill existing seats, which were previously agreed and ratified by the National Committee. 

This structure is interim until Momentum's February National Conference, after which all members will vote to decide Momentum's democratic structures going forward.

Members will only have received an e-ballot if a) when joining Momentum they indicated that they self-identify into one of the liberation strands, or b) live in an area not covered by a verified local group. 

Online voting will close at 12 noon on Tuesday 29 November 2016.",,status,,2016-11-23 06:31:59,15,15,8,15,0,0,0,0,0

The Prime Minister used her speech at the Confederation of British Industry's conference this morning to repeat her claim that the Conservative Government is building a country that works for everyone.

On the steps of Downing Street in July, Theresa May promised to stand up for 'just about managing' families, and pledged to protect the interests of workers by allowing them representation on company boards. Today, reports indicated that these families will be made ¬£2500 a year worse off under the Conservative Government by 2020, and the General Secretary of the Trade Union Congress, Frances O'Grady, accused the Prime Minister of failing to make good on her promise to deliver for ordinary people as she watered down her policy for workers' representation on company boards. 

Britain's future is uncertain, and despite the Prime Minister's words, it is clear the Government does not have the answers to the issues faced by the majority of British people. With their plans to further cut corporation tax and refusal to commit to stopping the welfare cuts that risk plunging thousands into poverty, the Tories continue to reinforce the rigged system that benefits their billionaire friends at the expense of ordinary people.

1. Take over the Democratic Party and return it to the people. They have failed us miserably. 

2. Fire all pundits, predictors, pollsters and anyone else in the media who had a narrative they wouldn't let go of and refused to listen to or acknowledge what was really going on. Those same bloviators will now tell us we must ""heal the divide"" and ""come together."" They will pull more hooey like that out of their ass in the days to come. Turn them off. 

3. Any Democratic member of Congress who didn't wake up this morning ready to fight, resist and obstruct in the way Republicans did against President Obama every day for eight full years must step out of the way and let those of us who know the score lead the way in stopping the meanness and the madness that's about to begin. 

4. Everyone must stop saying they are ""stunned"" and ""shocked"". What you mean to say is that you were in a bubble and weren't paying attention to your fellow Americans and their despair. YEARS of being neglected by both parties, the anger and the need for revenge against the system only grew. Along came a TV star they liked whose plan was to destroy both parties and tell them all ""You're fired!"" Trump's victory is no surprise. He was never a joke. Treating him as one only strengthened him. He is both a creature and a creation of the media and the media will never own that. 

5. You must say this sentence to everyone you meet today: ""HILLARY CLINTON WON THE POPULAR VOTE!"" The MAJORITY of our fellow Americans preferred Hillary Clinton over Donald Trump. Period. Fact. If you woke up this morning thinking you live in an effed-up country, you don't. The majority of your fellow Americans wanted Hillary, not Trump. The only reason he's president is because of an arcane, insane 18th-century idea called the Electoral College. Until we change that, we'll continue to have presidents we didn't elect and didn't want. You live in a country where a majority of its citizens have said they believe there's climate change, they believe women should be paid the same as men, they want a debt-free college education, they don't want us invading countries, they want a raise in the minimum wage and they want a single-payer true universal health care system. None of that has changed. We live in a country where the majority agree with the ""liberal"" position. We just lack the liberal leadership to make that happen (see: #1 above).

Let's try to get this all done by noon today.

A racist, misogynist demagogue has been elected President of the United States.

We extend our solidarity to the American people, in particular to women, people of colour, ethnic and religious minorities, migrants and LGBT+ people feeling afraid and abandoned today.

In our current system, wealth and power travels upwards, from the working and middle classes to the elite few at the top. Despite the hard work of many, the same few at the top reap all the rewards. Since the 2008 financial crisis the situation has worsened - inequality has sharply increased, living standards have fallen or stagnated, and many have been plunged into poverty and deprivation.

Trump has capitalised on this hardship and suffering, campaigning on a promise to create an economy that works for everyone. But Trump will not deliver this change. Neoliberal policies are responsible for the system that has benefited the few rather than the many, not the migrants, refugees and ethnic minorities who he has sought to scapegoat. 

Political parties have failed to address a system that has left the majority of people behind, and have failed to respond to cries against the status quo, creating a void which is increasingly being filled by the far-right in many countries. 

Progressives in the US, the UK and around the world must come together to stem this rising tide of fascism. We must condemn hate, division and discrimination. We must build support for a new economic programme, with fairness and environmental sustainability at its core, and social and foreign policies based on equality, justice and respect for human rights.

We must work together and organise in our communities to build support for an agenda for progressive change.

Today we have mourned. Now it's time to organise.

155710354774360_351933828485344,"UNANIMOUS STATEMENT FROM MOMENTUM STEERING COMMITTEE

The Steering Committee recognises and regrets the discontent and frustration felt by Momentum members in recent days. Momentum's democratic structures were always intended to develop. Unfortunately, this summer's leadership election delayed that development, with all our energy being diverted into ensuring Jeremy Corbyn's reelection.

The Committee recognises the need for a greater level of accountability and transparency from the leadership and administration of the organisation and will work to deliver that over the coming weeks.

Our path to democratisation, through our first National Conference in the new year, has not been sufficiently effectively communicated, leading, at times, to a breakdown in trust between different sections of our movement. There was not enough consultation and discussion with the diverse political and organisational traditions that exist in our movement. Pluralism is our strength, and all views must be properly engaged with.

After further discussion, the Steering Committee has agreed unanimously the following path for Momentum's democratisation, which places unity, pluralism and member-control at its heart.

The National Committee, postponed from this Saturday, will take place on 3 December. We will ensure that this meeting is properly representative, including new elections for our liberation strands where necessary. A plan for ensuring this will be submitted and approved by the Steering Committee at the latest by 11 November.

A further National Committee meeting will be held in January before our Conference in February. Our Conference, involving all members of Momentum, groups and affiliated organisations, will decide our organisation's long-term structure.

Taking into account the strong views on both sides of the OMOV (one member, one vote) vs. delegate for Conference votes, the Steering Committee has agreed on a recommendation to the National Committee of a suitable format. There will be both a physical delegates conference to thoroughly debate proposals submitted from the membership, and then OMOV voting on the proposals in the period after the conference. The details of this procedure will be determined over the coming weeks. 

We know all levels of Momentum are committed to a truly inclusive and democratic structure and will make it succeed over the next few months.",Photos from Momentum's post,photo,https://www.facebook.com/PeoplesMomentum/photos/a.160217227657006.1073741829.155710354774360/351933778485349/?type=3,2016-11-02 17:33:19,236,44,124,227,6,1,2,0,0

The event provided spaces for inclusive and respectful debate, where attendees had the opportunity to contribute to a radical, positive vision for the 21st century.

The Black-E was launched in 1968 as the UK's first community arts project ‚Äì a combination of a community centre and contemporary arts centre. Its history of a wide-ranging delivery of creative, political, developmental and educational activities and opportunities - in partnership with a wide range of organisations - means that the Black-E continues to be a national role model of both continuity and innovation.

Central to The Black-E has always been supporting communities and community organisations. The building's proximity to Britain's oldest established African Caribbean community, and to Europe's oldest Chinatown, means that cultural diversity is a root driver of the Black-E's raison d'etre. There is a wealth of evidence regarding the diversity of our users and partners, and the way in which the Black-E acts as a talent development hub for disengaged community members from disadvantaged communities across Liverpool. Within the Black E's programme last year, there were 19% disability focused elements, and 58% BME focused. What we offer young people especially, includes 'what they want, what they need, and what they have never dreamt of'.

Some the main projects currently include: providing a regular space for disadvantaged women to come together for social, health, cultural, and educational benefits ‚Äì groups include asylum seekers and refugees, migrants, isolated older women, abused women in refuges, and women with mental health issues. Another, pioneering, innovative and creative project is with young people under 13 with neurodevelopmental conditions ‚Äì the project offers a holistic approach with our partners also working with parents and carers. We provide the children, in the words of the Last Poets, with - 'affection, protection and direction'.

The Black-E has continued to open 5-days a week, be available for use on the other two days, form new partnerships, and develop existing and new projects. This has been against the backdrop of a significant 35% Arts Council cut a year and a half ago.

Support The Black-E now, so that we can continue with our work.

Having lived in London for 15 years, I have seen many changes take place. The lack of equal opportunities is dividing our communities. Nowhere is this disparity as stark as in education. Where you study and how you learn are some of the most defining factors in our lives. For the disfranchised a bad start can create lock in. As a technologist working in higher education, we aim to break this cycle by using digital technologies to create better, more accessible learning experiences. In the absence of adequate funding we are starting to see schools where there is hardly any digital literacy or teaching of computer skills. Not surprisingly, these are often in lower-income neighbourhoods with more ethnic minorities and immigrants. This propagates even more social inequality as these students are doubly discriminated against

Momentum's Steering Committee has voted, seven to three, to remove Jackie Walker as its Vice Chair, a position it elected her to. She remains a member of Momentum and its Steering Committee.

Jackie's actions at Labour Conference, in her subsequent Channel 4 interview, and by not understanding concern caused by her statements, have led the Steering Committee to view her behaviour as irresponsible and lose confidence in her as Vice Chair.

Having read reports of what Jackie Walker is alleged to have said, listened to the leaked video, and heard Jackie's version of events, the Committee does not regard any of the comments she appears to have made, taken individually, to be antisemitic. However, the Committee does consider her remarks on Holocaust Memorial Day and on security of Jewish schools to be ill-informed, ill-judged and offensive. In such circumstances, the Committee feels that Jackie should have done more to explain herself to mitigate the upset caused and should have been careful about statements on this and related subjects, whatever her record as an anti-racist, which the Committee applauds. 

Momentum is concerned that footage of a training session was leaked to the press. The leak is unacceptable and undermines much needed political education.

IT'S TIME to join the Labour Party so that we can really make a difference.

After years of throwing my breakfast at the TV, listening to evasive politicians failing to tackle the root problems, Jeremy brought sense and reason to mainstream politics. His determination to do more than a watered-down paint job but a complete renovation of our economic system inspires me to believe in change. 

I'm joining Labour because it's time for a humanitarian foreign policy. One based on pragmatic and peaceful diplomacy, a respect for all human life, and an acknowledgement of the movements of wealth that fuel conflict.

Political ideas can spring from songs, literature, film, pictures- all the many ways in which we imagine the world, how we live together, the possibilities and danger we face, all these are explored through art.

""Two fundamentally opposing visions are in conflict. The first seeks to market the parliamentary Labour party to majority public opinion, the press and big business as competent managers of the status quo. 

The second vision is one that sets the party a harder task: to win power in order to substantively change the country (as it did after world war two). This involves turning Labour into a social movement, with a mass membership playing an active day-to-day role in communities across the country, winning the battle for hearts and minds on the ground, countering the inevitable attacks from those with a vested interest in the Thatcher-Blair-Cameron settlement, and shaping party policy from the bottom up.""",Labour NEC wins voting appeal: our writers' verdict | Polly Toynbee and David Wearing,link,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/12/labour-party-appeal-leadership-election-decision-nec-corbyn-owen-smith,2016-08-12 12:04:00,448,79,122,380,5,2,0,13,48

Responding to the ruling, a spokesperson for Jeremy for Labour said:

""We think that this is the wrong decision - both legally and democratically.

The Court's ruling disenfranchises nearly 130,000 Labour members, who joined the party since January and were explicitly told that they would have a vote in any leadership election.

Crucial to the outcome today was the introduction of a new argument by the Labour Party HQ's lawyers, who invoked an obscure clause in the Labour Party rules (Chapter 4, Clause II, 1.A), which could be read as giving the NEC the right to ignore all of the rules laid out for leadership elections. In other words, this is a ""make it up as you go along"" rule. We do not think that making it up as you go along is a reasonable way to conduct democracy in our party.

Serious questions must be raised, however, over why and how the NEC Procedures Committee brought this appeal. In doing so, it effectively risked new members' money on an attempt to disenfranchise them. If we are to build a big, inclusive party to take on the Tories, we need to secure democracy in our party.""",,status,,2016-08-12 09:56:17,869,202,211,498,3,8,3,42,315

Cases like that of Mohammed Umar Farooq are illustrative.

The decision taken to freeze out new members since January was an affront to democracy and went against everything the party stands for.

We want to give collective representation to every person working in a business employing 250 people - so your wages, working hours, training, health and safety, overtime and grievance mechanisms will be in your hands.

Labour will protect workers by banning zero hours contracts and repealing the Trade Union Act - because no-one should have to live with the levels of insecurity workers currently face.

155710354774360_298514007160660,"The Mail on Sunday sent an undercover reporter into Momentum's offices posing as a volunteer over the last five weeks. The resulting piece in today's paper contains a number of misleading allegations against Momentum. 

As with all parts of the Momentum network, the staff and volunteer team at the national office are committed to building a kinder, fairer society based on cooperation, compassion and social justice. The team have an open door approach and have always welcomed people who want to volunteer their time and skills. We remain absolutely committed to this philosophy and will not be deterred by underhand, cynical and exploitative attempts to derail us. For a more balanced representation of the Momentum team and how we operate, here is Owen Jones' Guardian video when he visited the same offices that the Mail on Sunday had its mole in: 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKJxG38ctMY

Here is the statement we sent to The Mail on Sunday, which refutes and clarifies the allegations:

""The Mail on Sunday and Omar Wahid have exploited two of Momentum's strongest attributes: its enthusiastic and young activists and its open, welcoming approach. Wahid posed as a socially awkward volunteer of limited competence. As with other 'genuine' volunteers, he was warmly welcomed, given a variety of volunteer tasks to complete and offered friendship and kindness. In return, Wahid has undermined the trust and generosity of spirit of the Momentum team. It is particularly concerning that he appears to have targeted young, female volunteers and acted in a way that appears to proximate entrapment. 

In addition, he seems to have specifically targeted Muslim volunteers and activists in what looks like an attempt to smear them and Momentum as antisemitic. If this approach was indeed a deliberate strategy, it would appear to have Islamophobic undertones.

The Mail on Sunday's hypocrisy is striking. The paper used a mole, when also accusing Momentum of using a mole to find out about Tory party activities. It's clearly one rule for the right wing media and another for Momentum. 

T-shirts

If the allegations of the MoS are true, Momentum and one of its suppliers appear to have been misled by a third party supplier in relation to its labour practices. The order placed with this company has been cancelled and a new supplier sought with full ethical standards. 

Momentum is dedicated to championing rights at work both at home and overseas; we want every worker at home and broad to be in a trade union, and to enjoy the full protections that the ILO recommends as minimum standards. We will refuse to work with any supplier who does not uphold these standards.

MPAC

Momentum has no relationship with MPAC. Faduma Hassan has had no contact with MPAC either as an individual or on behalf of Momentum.

Wahid repeatedly asked Rob Lugg, who is a volunteer, not a ""senior official"", if he, Wahid, should be in contact with MPAC. Lugg response should be read in the context of his efforts to be polite to an apparently socially awkward volunteer. 

""Bullying""

Any bullying that is alleged will be investigated immediately, and any individual that is proven to have indulged in unacceptable behaviour will be dealt with through Momentum's code of conduct and, if necessary, stopped from any further participation in the organisation.

Sophie Nazemi, a 21-year-old volunteer, was clearly being humorous in light of the numerous unfounded allegations of bullying against Momentum. She joked that discussing Angela Eagle's voting record would be ridiculously and unfairly cast as ""low key bullying"" by Corbyn's opponents. Any claims that Nazemi is a bully, or endorses bullying or that Momentum is engaging in bullying are utterly false.

""Front organisations"" and ""proxies""

Novara Media is an independent media outlet. It existed before Momentum was launched. Aaron Bastani, the co-founder, negotiated access to Momentum to cover developments in the Labour Party. 

Michael Walker is a volunteer for Momentum. He also has made several appearances on Novara Media as a presenter. His volunteering for Momentum pre-dates his relationship with Novara Media. 

James McAsh, who is a volunteer not an ""official"", wrote an article for Novara about how the Labour's trigger ballot process works, in his own capacity. He often writes under a pseudonym. Other people who work for or volunteer for Momentum write articles on a range of subjects for a range of media outlets. This is not underhand but completely ordinary. 

The comments James Schneider made in the Friday 1 July meeting are very similar to ones given on the public record on the Today Programme on BBC Radio 4 the following morning, which were widely reported. He was speaking about embarrassing the failed coup plotters into putting up a candidate and stop attempting to subvert democracy in the Labour Party by forcing Corbyn out without an election. Momentum rejects any accusation that Schneider acted improperly.

Zac Goldsmith stunt

Momentum engaged in one successful media stunt during the London mayoral election to highlight questions around Zac Goldsmith's tax affairs. Momentum attempted a second stunt on the eve of polling. It was unsuccessful. Sadiq Khan's campaign team had no knowledge of the plans.

Update:

The Mail on Sunday put allegations about Marshajane Thompson to us which they did not publish. The Daily Mail did publish them the day before, including the incorrect claim that Thompson registered ""more than 100 fake voters"". 

Here is our statement sent to the Mail on Sunday:

Over a decade ago, Marshajane Thompson pleaded guilty to offenses of false instrument and false accounting, not electoral fraud, and completed community service. Marshajane's conviction is now spent. She has always been open about the conviction, which she still deeply regrets, with her employers. Momentum refutes efforts to smear Marshajane or Momentum.",Are you a bunch of far left extremists? | Owen Jones meets Momentum,video,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKJxG38ctMY,2016-07-23 18:50:45,980,160,550,803,25,5,4,6,137

Momentum is to agree a rigorous system of checks on materials and merchandise to ensure a zero tolerance policy on unethical practices anywhere in the supply chain.

This move has been taken after allegations surfaced that Momentum and one of its suppliers may have been misled by a third party supplier in relation to its labour practices. 

The order placed with this company has been cancelled and a new supplier sought with full ethical standards. 

Momentum will be looking at successful ethical trade initiatives in order to draw up a code of practice capable of maintaining confidence, in spite of the complexity of modern supply chains, that all campaign materials have been produced by businesses that respect labour rights and human rights. 

A spokesperson said: ""Momentum is dedicated to championing peoples rights at work both at home and overseas; we want every worker at home and abroad to be in a trade union, and to enjoy the full protections that the ILO recommends as minimum standards.

Many of our members and supporters will have watched in dismay as various restrictions were put in place to exclude hundreds of thousands of Labour Party Members and Supporters from voting in the upcoming leadership election.

We profoundly disagree with these moves, they are an attack on the democracy of the labour movement. A number of individual members are seeking legal advice, and the Labour NEC is due to meet again next Tuesday to further discuss these issues.

However, it is extremely important that members and supporters do what they can in the meantime to ensure they can take part in the leadership election. The options open are as follows:

‚Ä¢ If you are Labour Party member who joined before 12th January 2016 you should automatically have a vote. Please make sure the Labour Party has the correct contact details and address for you. You can do this at members.labour.org.uk or by calling 0345 092 2299 (better to do this online).

‚Ä¢ If you are a member of an affiliated trade union, or another affiliated organisation (e.g. The Fabians, LGBT Labour) and joined before 12th January 2016 then you can register as an affiliated supporter at support.labour.org.uk (if you registered last year you won't need to do so again unless your details have changed).

‚Ä¢ If neither of the above bullet points apply to you then, as things currently stand, if you want to vote then you will have to register between Monday 18th July and Wednesday 20th July and pay ¬£25 to be a registered supporter. You can register at support.labour.org.uk

If you can reasonably afford to pay the ¬£25 then we would strongly encourage supporters to do this from Monday.

We will keep our members and supporters updated on this issue as much as possible so watch this space.

155710354774360_292825047729556,"Black People Matter - A statement in response to the Chakrabarti Inquiry Report by Jackie Walker, Vice Chair, Momentum Steering Committee 

Shami Chakrabarti's Inquiry into Anti-Semitism and Racism in the Labour Party made big news soon as it was published ‚Äì and for all the wrong reasons, just one of the ongoing consequences of the ""occasionally toxic atmosphere"" that is ""in danger of shutting down free speech within the Party rather than facilitating it."" Chakrabarti makes it clear her intention is not to ""close down debate on delicate issues around all kinds of personal and political differences within the Party"" but to conduct these debates ""in a more trusting and constructive environment."" My response is made with the same intent.  

As a recently suspended Labour Party member, and the only person as yet (at the point of writing) exonerated, I was bound to read Chakrabarti's report, and the coverage that followed, with more than a little interest. I write as a long time Labour Party and anti-racist activist for whom Chakrabarti's findings are personally and politically important. My partner is Jewish, his family observant, but I comment as a woman of mixed Jewish and other heritages who identifies as, and is perceived by others as, a black person of African descent. 

Much of the mainstream media response to the Inquiry focused on anti-Semitism, was superficial, poorly informed or with one intent - destabilising Labour and its present leadership. Chakrabarti's generally well expressed 'state of the Party' contextualisation of race relations, and her many well thought through and sensible recommendations, were sidelined as charges of anti-Semitism yet again took centre stage, immediately undermining the Inquiry's key findings on BAME (Black and Minority Ethnic) members. 
At the core of the debate is the way competing claims by minorities are positioned in the (at this point in time) supercharged arena of Labour Party politics. In the political arena, perhaps more than elsewhere, race is about power - who has it, who is chosen to represent the Party, who gives power to others and how that power is communicated. Two areas are highlighted in the part of the Chakrabarti Report that focuses on BAME members - that of representation and vocabulary. 

Chakrabarti begins with evidence; that in 2010 the BAME community voted for Labour more than double in relation to whites. She describes an unwelcoming environment and a lack of representation at all levels, including in Parliament, but also in the administrative structures of the Party, singling out the lack of black members in the NEC for special mention. What an irony then that it is the voices of people of colour, in particular those of African descent, that were so effectively sidelined in reporting of the Inquiry. 

In today's Labour Party Chakrabarti situates anti-Semitism within a set of feelings and responses as reported in many submissions by some in the Jewish community. Stereotypes limit the ability of peoples to be treated and respected as individuals and Chakrabarti's comments on the need for sensitivity in the language of debate, whether on issues that relate to Israel or elsewhere, are to be welcomed. But there is acknowledgement that it is power, or the lack of it, that excludes and discriminates against BAME people in the Party, as it does of course in the rest of society. Blacks do not only feel under-represented, or stereotyped in the Party. They are under-represented. They may be members and supporters, they are of course, particularly in Labour's urban heartlands, often the foot soldiers and voters, but BAME members are effectively excluded where it matters - from power.  

Given the terms Chakrabarti was given for her inquiry it is difficult to see how this could have been avoided. If anti-Semitism is set apart from 'other forms of racism', can we be surprised when the Inquiry fails to attract a significant number of submissions from BAME groups, or when black individuals are significant only by their absence at its launch?  The reception of the Inquiry in the media and elsewhere simply underlined the powerlessness of the BAME community. The paucity of any black response, at a national level, confirms the exclusion the report attempts to redress. In this three card trick discrimination against BAME members is the card that appears, I hope only for the moment, to have been made to magically vanish.

I come now to the issue of vocabulary, in particular comments on the use of the term 'holocaust,' a point that concerns many people of African descent who await both recognition or recompense for past wrongs inflicted. 

Chakrabarti makes plain her Inquiry is an attempt to bring people together. To stand in solidarity, as Chakrabarti suggests all minorities need to, people of African descent must see the structures that exclude them from power, and have kept them silenced for so long, being changed.  This is the only way in which attempts to build an inclusive Party will succeed. 

Groups that have suffered oppression need to have conditions, a level playing field, in which they can form united political fronts, working in solidarity with others, rather than having to fight for a place at the table, forever bogged down in disputes about equity, access to power, or the meaning of the past. If the Party does not succeed in this, Labour will remain entangled in the impossible task of being a moral referee as minority ethnic groups engage in a 'competition of victimhoods' in order to gain, build or protect recognition. 

Others have argued elsewhere for dropping the use of the contested terminology of 'holocaust' and replacing it with 'genocide'.  Some suggest opening Holocaust Day more fully to all communities that have suffered mass murder. As Jews retain the word Shoah, so peoples of African descent refer to Maangamizi for their holocaust. Maangamizi describes the slave trade and history of enslavement when millions of Africans were killed, tortured, kidnapped and enslaved for profit but it also refers to the genocides and deprivations of colonialism and the ongoing, consequential suffering and oppressions of peoples of African descent. 

I am in agreement with Chakrabarti there are, and can be, no hierarchies of suffering. The Inquiry rightly warns of dilution of effect 'if every human rights atrocity is described as a Holocaust'. However, I cannot see the term 'holocaust' as something the Labour Party can, or should police, though it may provide a useful forum where terminology can be discussed. As ever, the Labour Party must recognise the right of minorities to both name themselves and choose how their history is narrated.

It is in the ability of the labour movement to listen to the experience of people of African descent and other BAME peoples where I now place my trust. It is with hope that I ask that our leaders listen to the concerns of people of colour whose voices before and during the Inquiry, and even now, remain barely heard. I look forward to the changes to come.",,status,,2016-07-13 13:36:03,79,9,25,72,4,1,0,2,0

""I am dismayed at the statement issued by Tom Watson announcing his withdrawal from talks aimed at resolving the crisis in the Labour Party.

""Extraordinarily I received no notice of this statement before it was issued. I had made arrangements for a meeting of trade union leaders, Tom Watson and representatives of the PLP and the Party Leader for tomorrow, arrangements requested by Tom Watson and his colleagues, specifically for Mr Watson's convenience.

""In that context, when the possibility of a workable plan had never seemed closer, Tom Watson's actions today can only look like an act of sabotage fraught with peril for the future of the Labour Party.

""I must clarify one point in Tom Watson's statement - I made it absolutely clear from the outset of these discussions that Jeremy Corbyn's resignation as the Leader was not on the agenda. Mr Watson knew that, and it is entirely wrong to suggest that any public statement by Jeremy represented any change in the situation. This is a deeply disingenuous manoeuvre.

""I will continue to work with trade union colleagues and others to chart a way forward, including meeting the legitimate concerns of Labour MPs. Should there have to be a leadership election, I must warn that any attempts to keep Jeremy Corbyn, elected just ten months ago with an enormous mandate, off the ballot paper by legal means risks a lasting division in the Party.

In these difficult times, we must redouble our efforts to treat each other with respect. As Jeremy Corbyn has repeatedly stated, personal abuse has no place in our politics, whether in the corridors of Westminster, at a party meeting, or online. 

While MPs must do more to engage with their members to understand how members wish to change the party, members must understand the vital role MPs and their staff play, especially in their constituencies. We call on Momentum's members to not demonstrate outside MP's offices or surgeries.

Despite the difficulties of the past two weeks, Labour's membership has grown dramatically and now stands at over half a million, the highest in decades. Labour is now the biggest left of centre membership party in Europe.

As we grow and welcome new members, we must always keep in mind that we achieve more by our common endeavour.",,status,,2016-07-08 09:40:16,1095,67,175,1037,56,0,0,2,0

That apology is owed first of all to the people of Iraq. Hundreds of thousands of lives have been lost and the country is still living with the devastating consequences of the war and the forces it unleashed.

They have paid the greatest price for the most serious foreign policy calamity of the last 60 years.

The apology is also owed to the families of those soldiers who died in Iraq or who have returned home injured or incapacitated.

They did their duty but it was in a conflict they should never have been sent to.

Finally, it is an apology to the millions of British citizens who feel our democracy was traduced and undermined by the way in which the decision to go to war was taken on the basic of secret 'I will be with you, whatever' understandings given to the US president that have now been publicly exposed.""",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/PeoplesMomentum/photos/a.160217227657006.1073741829.155710354774360/289212018090859/?type=3,2016-07-06 11:43:33,4877,236,2970,4510,274,3,1,84,5

Momentum welcomes the Chakrabarti Inquiry Report as an intelligent and sensitive engagement with a range of complex and highly emotive issues.

The Chakrabarti Report responds to the specific particularities of anti-Semitism within the broader context of anti-racism. Anti-Semitism and other forms of racism are real problems in British society and the Labour Party is not immune. Momentum recognises that being conscious of racism is the responsibility of all of us, we must all challenge racist ideas wherever they occur so that we can enable the Labour Party to be a political space where everyone can participate in discussion.

We also recognise the right of different communities to narrate their own histories using the language and terminology they are comfortable with while acknowledging the need for sensitivity and respect of how words may be perceived by other communities who have their own histories and experiences.

Finally, we welcome the Report's emphasis on the importance of establishing due process and natural justice in responding to complaints. It is vital that all in our party know that if they raise concerns they will be taken seriously and that everyone can have faith in the process.

We look forward to the full implementation of the report's recommendations.

Please read the report here, and share widely:

The government is in disarray. Ministers have made it clear they have no exit plan, but are determined to make working people pay with a new round of cuts and tax rises.

Labour has the responsibility to give a lead where the government will not. We need to bring people together, hold the government to account, oppose austerity and set out a path to exit that will protect jobs and incomes.

To do that we need to stand together. Since I was elected leader of our party nine months ago, we have repeatedly defeated the government over its attacks on living standards.

Last month, Labour become the largest party in the local elections. In Thursday's referendum, a narrow majority voted to leave, but two thirds of Labour supporters backed our call for a remain vote.

I was democratically elected leader of our party for a new kind of politics by 60% of Labour members and supporters, and I will not betray them by resigning. Today's vote by MPs has no constitutional legitimacy.

Momentum pledges its total commitment to Jeremy Corbyn as leader of the Labour Party. The last thing the country or the Labour Party needs in the Brexit confusion and before a snap general election is the Party to have a needless leadership election. 

Let's be clear; this attempted coup is unwarranted, undemocratic and irresponsible - as well as a waste of time and money.

If there is a leadership election, Jeremy will automatically be on the ballot paper. Momentum will campaign tirelessly for him, and he will win. 

In an attempt to further destabilise the leadership and undermine the membership's support for it, rumours have been peddled today that Momentum doesn't support Corbyn and instead wishes to back John McDonnell. These rumours are categorically untrue. They are lies designed to do harm to our movement.

Momentum exists to create the social movement Jeremy promised, on which Labour will depend to beat the Tories and cut though public disenchantment with the failures of the political elite.

John McDonnell told the Sunday Politics earlier today that he will be the chair of Jeremy's leadership campaign should reckless MPs force an irresponsible leadership election on the Party.

The division promoted by a section of the parliamentary party is the last thing we need. 

We call for unity and for all of the PLP to get behind Jeremy and the Labour Party to offer a programme of hope for our people.

The Prime Minister's resignation has triggered a Tory leadership crisis. At the very time we need politicians to come together for the common good, the Tory party is plunging into a period of argument and infighting. In the absence of a government that puts the people first Labour must unite as a source of national stability and unity.

It should focus on speaking up for jobs and workers' rights under threat, and on challenging any attempt to use the referendum result to introduce a more right-wing Tory government by the backdoor. 

The last thing Labour needs is a manufactured leadership row of its own in the midst of this crisis and we call upon all Labour MPs not to engage in any such indulgence.

155710354774360_283522648659796,"Statement on Britain's vote to leave the EU

Yesterday, the British people voted to leave the European Union. Momentum, which campaigned to remain in the EU to transform the EU, respects the decision taken by the electorate.

We recognise that people voted 'Leave' for many reasons. Much of this vote reflected anger in communities which have experienced many years of industrial decline with the subsequent loss of secure employment. Many such working class communities have been utterly neglected for years by those in power. Millions appear to have chosen 'Leave' to vote against the unfettered globalisation that has seen living standards stagnate or fall, as the cost of living rises. We share this scepticism of big business dominance, austerity and distant elites, be they British, European or Global, and share that demand for a country where working people have control.

Many 'Leave' voters usually vote for Labour or are working people Labour should represent. Now the Party and the whole labour movement needs to show the country that it alone can offer working people genuine control over their lives, workplaces and communities.

Labour must clearly demonstrate how it will improve lives through policies that will increase wages, tackle the housing crisis, and give people a greater say at work and in their communities.

If we do not, we will not only be failing to advance the policies that will benefit working people but also could enable the populist right, who blame immigrants, not the powerful for the problems in our country. Part of the Leave campaign empowered these racist, reactionary forces, who peddle hatred and offer false hope. We must redouble our efforts to stop migrant scapegoating, focus our attention on the needs and desires of the overwhelming majority, and offer a real programme of hope for our people.

Although we will leave the EU, our movement remains an internationalist one. We must continue to work with our friends, partners and allies across Europe in the shared struggle against austerity, to tackle climate change and to build a sustainable economy with full employment for all the peoples of Europe.",,status,,2016-06-24 00:43:08,720,76,463,650,24,0,0,42,4

Here's why this rally was organised in the first place -

""The marginalisation of voices outside of the Westminster bubble is why I have organised a Yes to Europe rally in Trafalgar Square this evening aimed at engaging young people to vote in and get their reasons for doing so heard. The response has been incredible. In less than a week, almost 3,000 people have clicked attending, and I have received countless messages from people offering their help or support.""

Fed up with the EU debate being dominated by 'Project Fear' and men in suits arguing with each other, there has been a huge, last minute surge in activity across the country from volunteers organising citizen-led doorknocking, phonebanking, leafleting and other actions through our Your Referendum platform.

Today, Momentum and Another Europe is Possible organised hundreds of people to gather at the Thames today. As Farage's Brexit flotilla passed by Westminster, activists dropped a 100 ft banner over the side of Westminster bridge with the message, ""Don't let Farage sink Britain. Vote remain.""

The hypocrisy of Farage pretending to be on the side of Britain's fishing industry was a little too much to take, given that he has
attended just 1 out of 42 meetings of the European Parliament's Fishing Committee. 

Instead, over a 100 people, many of whom are young and new to politics, are expressing their positive vision for a social Europe, where fishing communities, and all workers, have rights and protection; a reformed Europe based on cooperation, rights for workers, opportunities for young people and environmental justice.

Any attempt to deflect this as Sky did here in an interview with Owen Jones is simply unacceptable. 

If someone kills Jews because they are Jews, it's an anti-Semitic hate crime and nothing else. If someone kills black people because they are black, it's a racist hate crime and nothing else. If someone deliberately goes into a gay venue and kills 50 people because they are gay, it's a homophobic hate crime and nothing else. 

Our solidarity needs to go 100% with the LGBT community and the reaction of some commentators and politicians is shameful for trying to make this appalling crime out to be something it was not.

155710354774360_276479422697452,"Rhea Wolfson's campaign for Labour's National Executive Committee is still ongoing. Following the incredible amount support she has received, it's clear there is a massive demand for what she offers the party: important perspectives and promoting a credible democratic socialist agenda, and to empower members to fight for a more democratic party that can deliver change. Read her full statement: 

""Thank you so much for all the kind tweets, messages, endorsements, and nominations. Without these I might have given up last week, with them I am convinced that we can win.
This campaign is not over.

Last summer, I moved back to Scotland to provide end-of-life care for my father. Since then, I have split my time between my family home and that of my partner. I am sure that many other young members will find this kind of living arrangement very familiar!

Labour Party rules stipulate that members should register at only one address, and therefore only one Constituency Labour Party (CLP). Despite spending more time, and being more politically active, at my partner's, I have been registered at my family home. This is, in part, due to an emotional connection to the area: it was here that I first campaigned for the Labour Party in 2005, and where I volunteered in my local MSP's constituency office when still at school.

Last week, I was unsuccessful in securing a nomination from Eastwood, the CLP I grew up in. I released a statement on this and will not be commenting further. Since then, I have been overwhelmed by the support I have received from members up and down the UK. This has confirmed for me the reasons why I first wanted to stand: to promote a positive and credible democratic socialist agenda, and to empower members to fight for a more democratic party that can deliver change.
I have transferred my membership to my other address and will seek nomination from my home CLP. If successful, I will be an officially nominated candidate for Labour's National Executive Committee.""

It is an absolute scandal that private companies should be able to profiteer in our publicly funded health service.  NHS campaigners are fighting to stop this with the the NHS Reinstatement Bill.

On Tuesday 28th June, at 5pm, an important meeting will be held in parliament to brief MPs on the issue, organised by campaigners and chaired by Rachael Maskell MP, Labour MP for York Central and former head of health at Unite.

We can all help by writing to our MPs and asking them to attend this meeting and support the Bill. If there's a strong turn-out of MPs at the meeting, there's a good chance that the Bill will be re-tabled again in the Commons as a cross party Bill presented by Labour.

But in austerity Britain, local services can easily come under pressure, and people can become alarmed about the changing nature of their communities. A lot of these concerns have fuelled opposition to the EU, and contributed to the rise of UKIP. Today Jeremy Corbyn set out the case for staying in Europe, and the pragmatic Labour argument for managed migration:

""[People concerned about migration aren't] Little Englanders, xenophobes or racists. More people living in an area can put real pressure on local services like GPs surgeries, schools and housing.

This isn't the fault of migrants. It's a failure of government. The coalition government in 2010 abolished the Migrant Impact Fund; a national fund to manage the short term impacts of migration on local communities. By abolishing it, David Cameron's Coalition undermined the proper preparation and investment that communities need to adapt. 

We cannot and should not want to close the borders. But we do have to make sure that public services are able to sustain the communities we have here, part of that is through a Migrant Impact Fund, but partly too it is about reversing the damaging and unnecessary austerity policies that this government continues to impose on our communities and our country.""

155710354774360_269532236725504,"Ann Pettifor, one of Labour's economic advisers, spoke alongside John McDonnell at Momentum Bedford's event last night. 

We're certainly living in hopeful and exciting times, with some of the world's top economists, such as Ann Pettifor, Yannis Varoufakis and Joseph Stigltiz, helping Labour carve out a new economic strategy to deliver equality and justice in the 21st century. 

250 people packed out a community centre in Bedford last night to discuss the future of our #neweconomics. 

The rich and powerful will always have easy access to the levers of power, ready to hinder and undermine any attempt to bring about a more equal and fair society. That's why it's so important that we build the movement, Momentum, to act as a counter-weight to that.
 
Economics is not just about what happens in the City of London. It's about what happens in our town halls and community centres too.

""Austerity is far bigger than that [cuts]: it is a project irreversibly to transfer wealth from the poorest to the richest. It's doing the job very nicely: while the typical British worker is still earning less after inflation than he or she was before the banking crash, the number of UK-based billionaires has nearly quadrupled since 2009.

Ken Livingstone was initially one of the CGLA candidates but as he is currently suspended from the Party he is unable to stand. Therefore, Rhea Wolfson has been added in his place. 

Rhea, who last year actively supported Jeremy Corbyn's leadership campaign, is a young Scottish activist, Co-Chair of the Co-op Party Youth and GMB activist. She said ""Our party needs to be strong and united, with all levels of the party working in a transparent and tolerant manner. I will work to empower members, local parties, and activists; to fight for a more democratic party that can deliver change - and ultimately, deliver victory."" 

To support Jeremy's leadership, please consider encouraging your CLP to nominate the CLGA candidates: Rhea Wolfson, Ann Black, Claudia Webbe, Darren Williams, Christine Shawcroft, and Pete Willsman.

On behalf of the Labour Party and its leadership, I would like to express my sincere thanks to each and every Momentum member and supporter who played a part in our tremendous effort to secure Labour wins in the elections last week.
Whilst we have a long way to go to rebuild our trust with the electorate in Scotland, there is a strong showing for Labour in England and Wales. These results are a real improvement on the 2013, 2014 and 2015 local elections and show that Labour under Jeremy leadership has a firm base to build from. 48% of councillors elected last week are Labour, in comparison to the Tories' 30% and Labour are not just the biggest party, but have an overall majority in 58 of the 124 councils up for election.

What is more, we held our own or advanced in key marginal councils with Tory MPs, including: Worcester, Redditch, Derby, Ipswich, Norwich, Harlow, Crawley, Southampton and Hastings. Not to mention the four excellent Labour mayors we've elected in London, Bristol, Liverpool and Salford. I know that Momentum groups have been particularly active in many of these areas, and indeed elsewhere, so thank you for the remarkable impact you have made.

What is perhaps most heart-warming of all, is the knowledge that Momentum groups played a key role in mobilising many new and less experienced activists. Jeremy's leadership inspired many tens of thousands of people to join Labour and get involved in politics for the first time, and now that fresh energy lives on in Momentum.

Searching #Momentum4Labour on social media shows months of Momentum's superb campaigning for Labour, with the ""Six O'Clock Squad"" in Plymouth, Sheffield's solidarity road trips to Rotherham, the #WheresZacsTax stunts and #JezWeKhan post-canvassing socials in London, Momentum groups are pioneering creative and engaging ways of doing politics.
So, now what? We have a solid Labour base in England and Wales, but there is much more work to be done. If you're not already, I would urge you join the Labour Party and to join Momentum as well. Becoming a member of Momentum will enable to you to be part of and shape a growing network of people and groups who are committed to building a more democratic and equal society and see a Jeremy-led Labour Party in government.

There has never been a better time to get involved in politics.

Join Labour and Join Momentum. Let's build our movement.

Momentum condemns the suspension of Jackie Walker, Vice Chair of our Steering Committee, from the Labour Party on 4 May. Jackie, a black activist of Jewish heritage and lifelong anti-racist campaigner and trainer, was suspended by the party for alleged antisemitism following an article that appeared in the Jewish Chronicle, which quotes statements she made on Facebook discussing her family history.

We are extremely concerned by the lack of due process in this case, and the failure to apply the principles of natural justice. Journalists were briefed about Jackie's suspension by party staff before she had been informed. Indeed, she is still yet to receive any formal notification of either her suspension, the basis for it, or a timetable for her hearing. As the suspension was not briefed to the press as 'without prejudice', it has been interpreted by some as a presumption of guilt before any process has taken place. 

Momentum calls for the immediate lifting of her suspension and for new rules to be put in place by the party to govern the handling - and the press briefing - of sensitive disciplinary matters, and for all suspensions to be agreed in advance by NEC members after the person concerned has the right to make representations.

Momentum unambiguously condemns antisemitism and welcomes Jeremy Corbyn's launch of an expert-led inquiry. 

We hope that this inquiry is the start of a process of investigating how all forms of racism and oppression that exist in society replicate themselves in any way within the Labour Party. For the labour movement to fight racism and oppression effectively, we need comradely self-criticism, education, and awareness raising of these complex issues. We pledge that Momentum will play a productive role in this process.",,status,,2016-05-09 13:29:31,199,31,97,191,0,1,0,6,1

1)  Jeremy Hunt has completely failed to deal with this situation and has allowed it to escalate to an all out strike. He is not fit to be Health Secretary.

2) David Cameron has also completely failed to intervene and handle this dispute, allowing a Health Secretary to impose a contract against the will of 98% of those it is being imposed upon. He is not fit to be Prime Minister.

3) This attack on the pay and conditions of Junior Doctors is part of a broader agenda to undermine the core values and principles of our publically funded health service, free at the point of care. The Tories are not fit to be in government.

This government has shown that they have little regard for our NHS. If we let them, they will systemically dismantle it over the next 4 years. All that can stop them is us. Our collective action.

As the steel crisis threatens Britain's industrial capability, thousands of jobs, and the devastation of entire communities, the labour movement urgently needs to put forward a coherent, progressive alternative to the government's wilful inaction.
That is why Momentum is calling for permanent public ownership of the steel industry as part of a forward-looking industrial strategy.

With steel publicly owned by workers, communities, and a strategic state, the UK will be better placed to develop a high tech, high productivity economy, which grows our industrial base and produces shared prosperity. Public ownership will give working people control over a strategic asset to develop our economy, build homes, improve our national infrastructure, and support public services, as well as safeguard the workers and communities that built the steel industry.

We are not calling for control from Whitehall but a genuinely democratic public ownership, run by workers and communities with strategic input from the state.

We support Labour's campaign to expose the Tories' indifference to the steel industry, steelworkers and their communities and call on Labour to adopt permanent public ownership as part of an industrial strategy as party policy.",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/PeoplesMomentum/photos/a.160217227657006.1073741829.155710354774360/248117312200330/?type=3,2016-04-14 08:08:22,60,3,28,59,1,0,0,0,0

The successful launch featured a positive panel discussion with John Cruddas MP, Seema Malhotra MP, Stephen Kinnock MP and Cllr Sam Tarry. John McDonnell popped in to join the audience of MPs, Labour members and supporters from across the Labour spectrum.

Momentum Steering Committee member, Sam Tarry, was well received by the room when he called for the Labour Party to embrace the ideas, energy and wisdom of the new membership. He called for investment in community organising and digital campaigning to engage more people in politics and build a credible economic alternative that works in the interests of the many. 

John Cruddas and Stephen Kinnock both condemned members of the Parliamentary Labour Party who brief the media against the new leadership, calling the behaviour ""disgraceful."" 

Whilst it was recognised that consensus may not always be reached on areas of genuine political difference, it was highlighted that there is overwhelming consensus for Labour as an anti-austerity party committed to delivering a more democratic and equal society.

I'm sure we'll all be pleased to engage in a more consensual style of politics. After all, it was Jeremy's new kind of politics that inspired many tens of thousands of people to join the Labour Party last summer.

Teachers and Doctors are custodians of a powerful idea; that everyone has the right to a flourishing life. That's why this Government wants to break us""

We live in interesting times‚Ä¶.

We seem to have a government ruling by decree. A government contemptuous of democratic norms.

A few weeks ago this Government made clear that it would attempt to impose a new doctors' contract upon the junior doctors; and the same Government only a few days ago also signaled its intention to force ""academisation"" onto every school in the country. These two ""impositions"" (against the counsel of both the medical and teaching professions) are the latest examples of a nasty authoritarianism that seems to lie at the heart of the Conservative project.

By simultaneously imposing far-reaching and unevidenced reforms on both teachers and doctors the Conservatives want us to perceive this authoritarian style of government as the ""new normal"". They will not succeed in that. There is no way that we doctors are going to accept this deplorable state of affairs, and it looks like teachers won't either.

The Conservatives have form on this kind of thing.

Take school academisation for example. When I read about the new Government white-paper I was struck at how similar their tactics are to the manner in which they rolled-out a previous piece of pernicious and damaging legislation. 4 years ago the Government initiated the most far-reaching top-down reorganisation that the NHS had ever seen; the Health and Social Care Act 2012. This ended the government's duty to provide a comprehensive and universal health service in England. It deepened existing market mechanisms within the NHS and opened up the NHS to external private providers of health care (all this occurring along the biggest squeeze on health funding since the inception of the health service).

School academisation is directly analogous to the above process.

It is an attack on the very idea of comprehensive education.

Just as the new Academy ""chains"" can absolve themselves of the obligation to educate every child in any given geographical area (and ""cherry-pick"" instead), so too do the new NHS CCG's absolve themselves of treating all patients in a given geographical area. Just as academisation is justified as simply an attempt to put power into the hands of Teachers and Headmasters so too was the same claim made about the Health and Social Care Act; that it was about ""empowering clinicians"".

The reality of both process it that they reduce accountability. Both processes encourage private sector involvement. Both processes undermine national bargaining on terms and conditions. Both processes erode national minimum standards. Both processes do nothing to solve the recruitment and retention crises faced by our respective professions.

So, whilst both processes are touted as benign and devolved they are in-fact highly centralised and undemocratic, whereby all hospital trusts and all schools are being forced to accept their new ""independent"" status. We are witnessing a centrally directed fragmentation of both the health and education services; with a view to enabling privatisation by stealth.

The Government have shown that they have no qualms about misleading a compliant media and systematically misinforming the public.

But we, teachers and doctors, will not be misled. Because we share something more than just the huge responsibilities of our day to day jobs.

What we share is an insight. An insight into how harsh society can be as well as how magnificent, and vulnerable, human potential is.

We therefore have a direct view of exactly what this government is trying to do.

We know that rising child poverty means that those born today will from their very first few days on this Earth start to feel the indelible imprint of austerity on their cognition, their bodies and their social relationships.

We know about the moral necessity of a robust welfare state to provide for the disabled and the troubled.

We have first-hand experience of the unequal life trajectories of patients and pupils within a sharply delineated class society.

We see the consequences of social breakdown on a daily basis and we are the ones who pick up the pieces.

As doctors and teachers, we (along with other NHS and education workers) are some of the last, remaining representatives of the social democratic consensus in this country. 
 We are the custodians of a powerful idea: that everyone has the right to a flourishing life.

And the fact that we together are the bedrock of that social democratic consensus is the very reason why this conservative government is gunning for us, why it wants to break us.
 The government will not succeed. Although they are they are trying their utmost best to tear apart the social fabric of this country Cameron, Osborne and Hunt have failed to take into account one crucial thing‚Ä¶..the determination of tens of thousands of determined doctors and teachers.

As trade union members we stand ready to defend our services. By standing up for ourselves, we stand up for patients, for pupils and for the future of a civilised society.

Doctors are escalating their action as we go into April.

On the 26th of March, teachers at the National Union of Teachers voted to ballot for industrial action.

We are probably entering the most important period of industrial action in a generation.

The Government is right now at its weakest and most divided.

It's authoritarianism is a sign of desperation and haste.

We are entering the endgame.
 How this plays out will determine the kind of country that we bequeath to the future.",,status,,2016-03-29 12:00:01,178,13,89,168,9,0,0,1,0

I'm angry that this island
Where we once shot fascists down
Now queues in droves to cast its votes
To let them run this town
I'm angry that your colour
Your culture, creed and class
Define you and resign you
To being written off en masse
So don't you dare say I'm ungrateful
I should be happy with my lot
You wonder why I'm angry?
I wonder why you're NOT.

""Yet, tragically, the present government is doing its best to dismantle the NHS, with the ultimate goal, it would seem, of replacing it with the US model. The Health and Social Care Act of 2012 put an end to the mandate for the state to provide comprehensive healthcare to every resident of England free at the point of use, and has allowed for-profit companies to buy up huge chunks of the NHS (¬£10 billion worth of contracts have already been handed out since the Act was passed).  The Tories know the US system performs worse on every conceivable count, but they are willing to go there anyhow: the healthcare market-in-waiting is just too juicy to leave untapped.

Bevan knew that the NHS would face opposition from powerful private interests, but he was hopeful that it would prevail: ""The NHS will stand,"" he said, ""as long as there are those who will fight for it."" Many Britons are doing just that. But, thanks to skillful government subterfuge, the vast majority do not even know that their cherished healthcare system is under threat, and many others don't understand what it's like to live with the dysfunctions of a private alternative.

Eighteen London children aged between six and twelve years old gathered in Limehouse Town Hall, east London during half term to learn the basics of junior doctoring from their striking elders.

Later this year, parliament will vote on the renewal of Trident; a decision which would save over a ¬£100 billion of public money.

Despite being called a nuclear deterrent, many are questioning whether Trident actually makes us safer against the 21st century threats of terrorism, cyber-attacks or climate change.

The NHS Trust that runs Royal Stoke University Hospital in Staffordshire put together a consortium with other NHS hospitals to enter what they called a ""competitive bid"" for a 10-year contract to run scans across Cheshire, Staffordshire, Shropshire, Liverpool, and Lancashire. The scans, known as PET-CT, are mostly used for diagnosing and measuring cancers, and are a vital tool for fighting the disease.

However, NHS England, the ""head office"" of the health service, rejected the bid from state-run providers and instead awarded the contract to Alliance Medical, a private health firm whose board members include leading Conservative MP Malcolm Rifkind.""

""Having suffered a spinal injury in 1979, I am only too aware of the importance of the medical facilities and the appropriate medical personnel necessary for effective rehabilitation.  

During the Israeli army's onslaught on the Gaza Strip in the summer of 2014, this most 'moral army' was given the coordinates of institutions which serve the humanitarian needs of Gaza's residents. The hope was that this would give Israel no excuse for obliterating the infrastructure for life to continue in Gaza. 

Although provided with locations of medical facilities, facilities which are given protected status in times of conflict, the deliberate destruction of Al-Wafa Rehabilitation Hospital in Gaza during the summer of 2014, has left no treatment facilities, nor equipment, for those who suffer spinal injuries.  Twisted debris is all that remains of both equipment and hospital following Al-Wafa's destruction.  

With work and fundraising going on elsewhere to rebuild hospital facilities, my aim is to support MAP's joint programmes of training Palestinian neurosurgeons and purchasing much needed equipment for individuals who have suffered a spinal cord injury.""",Click here to support James,link,http://bit.ly/1KmRYMf,2016-02-16 12:00:01,43,3,7,43,0,0,0,0,0

His fight with junior doctors over pay and changes to what constitutes working 'social hours' is coming to a head this week as medics prepare to stage a second 24-hour strike.

But one doctor has indulged in a bit of light-hearted joshing to show up the health secretary's own commitment to working weekends in South West Surrey, at least by holding surgeries with any number of his 75,000 constituents.

A letter in today's 'Telegraph', penned by Dr Malcolm Parsloe, mocked the MP's ""waiting times"":

""SIR - On Friday I rang the constituency office of Jeremy Hunt, the Health Secretary, for a surgery appointment. The receptionist said none were available for a month. I asked if there were any weekend surgeries but was told he only does Friday"".""

""I'm a Labour member, a Momentum member, and a lifelong socialist who joined, like so many, because the election of Jeremy Corbyn as leader filled me with hope.

I'm a rabble-rousing, placard-waving leftist, but these days, you're likely to find me on the doorstep, Labour sticker affixed to my suede jacket, talking to voters. I'd like to encourage other members new to the party, particularly my fellow socialists inspired by Jeremy, to join me.

...In Plymouth, as in many other places, our Momentum group is vibrant and strong, and I hope to see everyone who is able on the doors and phones, speaking to voters. I passionately believe in Momentum's mission to reform the Labour Party, and I believe that this election gives us our chance. In my first time canvassing, I and other new members knocked doors alongside Tudor Evans, the leader of Plymouth City Council, and many other experienced Labour activists. In our shared work, we get to know each other; many a fruitful dialogue might start as a chat between two rain-soaked volunteers drinking tea before heading out for another round. Political activity shapes us; by working to win this election, we new members can help shape our party.""

""Since Jeremy Corbyn put his name forward as a potential leader, hundreds of thousands of people have joined the Labour Party. Jeremy's honest, straight-talking politics has captured the public's imagination. He has, however, faced daily attacks from some of the media and his political opponents. And he has responded with courage and dignity.

The night is hosted by blisteringly funny Jen Brister and features:

Jeremy Hardy, former Perrier Award Winner, actor and writer; Ken Livingstone, former Leader of the GLC, former Mayor of London; Francesca Martinez, 'Live at the Apollo', 'Extras', campaigner against welfare reform ('WOW petition'); Brian Eno, musician, composer, record producer; Ken Loach, director of 'Kes', 'Riff Raff' and many other award-winning films; Lindsey German, convenor of Stop the War; Ava Vidal, 'Michael McIntyre's Comedy Roadshow', 'Mock the Week', 'This Week'; Michael Rosen, former Children's Poet Laureate; Grace Petrie, singer/songwriter (described by the Guardian as ""a powerful new songwriting voice"").

Please note, show starts at 19:45.""

""To: Iain McNicol, General Secretary of the Labour Party

Please launch a crowdfunding campaign amongst the Labour Party membership to pay for delegates passes, accommodation and travel to Youth Conference in Scarborough on the weekend of the 26-28th February 2016.

Why is this important?

Despite attempts to persuade him privately, Iain McNicol, General Secretary of the Labour Party, is refusing to budge on the cost of Youth Conference. Labour are already charging elected delegates ¬£40 for their conference pass (seven times the national minimum wage for most young members), this is without provision for accommodation or travel, meaning in reality the cost of Youth Conference will come to ¬£200 or more for most delegates. This is the first Youth Conference in two years and the first youth elections conference in three years. Delegates have been elected by the entire youth membership regionally to represent them at #YL16, the lack of funding to get delegates there is pricing young members out of democracy and only the Party can resolve this issue.

Unless this issue is resolved, Young Labour's democracy runs the risk of looking like that of pre-universal suffrage Britain, in which only those with wealth will have the right (or ability) to vote; the Chartists, whose struggle led to the creation of the Labour Party, would not be impressed.

How it will be delivered

I intend to email the list of signatures to Iain McNicol as well as handing them to him in person.""

""I had always voted Labour. Always. That was until there came a point where I just couldn't any more,"" Joe Bryce, 54, from Glasgow says. ""Iraq was the heart of why I left the Labour party.""

Bryce, a lawyer, is one of the thousands of former party members from across the UK who have returned to Jeremy Corbyn's Labour after leaving while Tony Blair was leader.

He lives in a city that comprehensively rejected Labour in the general election, and looks set to do the same in May's Scottish parliament elections. Despite that, Joe is now cautiously optimistic for the future of his party.

""We're on the way back. It won't be easy, but it can be done.

""I was a member of the Labour party because I believed in the NHS, the welfare state and traditional Labour values,"" he says, ""and too often we didn't live up to those values.""

Political parties are generally tight-lipped about their membership numbers, but figures suggest that between the start of the Iraq war in 2003 and Labour losing the 2010 election, 70,000 people left the party.

Revealed: how Jeremy Corbyn has reshaped the Labour party
For some it was an immediate reaction, tearing up membership cards the day that MPs voted for the invasion of Iraq, but for Joe his anger had begun earlier: ""My support began to wane after clause IV, but I kept voting for Labour up until the Iraq war.

""I wasn't totally critical of New Labour. There were a few good things about the Blair/Brown governments, especially during the first term.""

But Iraq that was the final straw. ""I couldn't continue to support the party after that. The alienation after Iraq was always total. It quickly became apparent that there were no weapons of mass destruction. There was no accountability. No punishment for what happened there.""

Bryce, who specialises in asylum law, gave his support to other parties.

""I voted yes in the referendum on Scottish independence. I was disgusted by the rightward lunge of the UK, and I thought we could claw it back if we left. I voted Green in 2010. I liked Ed Miliband but I thought his team was a little too far to the right, and he was dragged there.""

On 12 September, Bryce rejoined Labour. When asked the reason he's emphatic: ""Jeremy Corbyn is a great man who has the right ideas for the country.""

He doesn't see Corbyn as a dangerous radical. ""The only place he really went on a limb,"" he says, ""was with his views on nuclear disarmament, where I agree with him completely.""

So what does Labour have to say to win back Scots, and, more specifically, people like him?

""Jeremy has said that austerity is a choice ‚Äì that resonates with people. If Labour make that message clear it can only be a good thing.

""If we get behind this movement it could really change the UK for the better.""

""At 25, Laura Fisher is one of the older members of Young Labour (the age range for the group is 16-26).

According to a YouGov poll, young people were most likely to select Jeremy Corbyn as their favoured choice in the run-up to the Labour leadership election, and thousands of them crowded into halls to hear him speak. The ranks of Young Labour swelled in areas where the group was almost defunct.

A charity worker living in Tooting, south London, Fisher was one of the many young people who became enamoured of Corbyn in 2015, joining the party in June after supporting Labour for the first time at the general election. She did more than just cast her vote in favour of Corbyn, she also worked on a phone bank, attempting to persuade constituency Labour party members to vote for him, and went out door-knocking.

""I've come close to meeting him but getting through the crowds of people was too difficult,"" she says. ""He reminds me of those teachers in school who were really cool and you really liked and didn't want to annoy them because they'd tell you they were disappointed with you. I did convince one person on the phone to vote for him, which was the greatest moment.""

A key reason for Fisher's involvement in Corbyn's Labour party is the anti-austerity stance. She has seen close friends and family struggle with the benefit cuts and the bedroom tax.

""My cousin is going to university soon and her mum is being forced to look for new accommodation. It's ridiculous that she's going to be penalised because her daughter is going to be away getting an education,"" she says.

Fisher, who grew up in Lincolnshire, does not come from a political family. She explains that her politics have been influenced by a combination of studying the subject at A-level and her personal experiences. Her mother, who lives in York with her grandfather, came close to being flooded this Christmas which, she says, reminded her of why she dislikes the Conservatives.

""You saw people's lives and livelihoods completely ruined. If you drove out of my mum's house there was this whole stretch of road which was a basically a pond. The Conservatives focus so much of their attention on what's beneficial to them. I don't feel like Corbyn would operate in that way.""

Fisher finds the idea that Corbyn's politics are a return to the 1970s and 80s, as has been argued by some commentators, to be a naive line of argument. She feels ""old white men"" in Tooting were using her age against her when they employed this rhetoric.

""Corbyn would not have got elected if he was saying things that were rooted in the 70s and 80s, because he couldn't possibly have engaged people who were my age or even younger. Actually I think he's more rooted in Labour origins which have been lost over time,"" she says. ""If he is going back it's only in a positive way.""

""Momentum will elect an interim national committee next month to draw up the group's first ""democratic, representative, inclusive and pluralist"" constitution and put structures in place to pursue its aim of creating a ""democratic, equal and just society.""

The committee will include people elected by regional meetings of delegates from verified local Momentum groups and representatives from affiliated trade unions and leftwing groups, such as the Labour Representative Committee. It will also include representatives from under-represented groups, such as BAME, disability, LGBT and women, to ensure balance. All delegates and committee members will have to be Labour Party members.

The committee will consult with Momentum activists to develop a constitution and structure that enables local groups to organise effectively in their communities; encourages trade union participation at local, regional and national level; and ensures the group is financially sustainable. It is then expected to devolve itself in six month and be replaced by a new committee elected through its new structures.

James Schneider, a spokesperson for the group, told LabourList: ""Momentum is excited about the forthcoming formation of our first National Committee. It represents our next stage in creating an inclusive, participatory and effective organisation involving a wide range of stakeholders, including trade unions.""""

Unfortunately, we are not being wished a happy new year by the Tories. Rail fares are set to rise by a further 1.1%. Shadow transport secretary, Lilian Greenwood, has said that the hikes amount to a ""truly staggering"" rise of ¬£2000 in cash terms since 2010. 

Over the last five years rail fares have risen nearly three times faster than average wages. Commuters will be paying an average of 25% more for rail season tickets since David Cameron took office. Despite the high cost, our trains are often late, overcrowded and understaffed.

British passengers continue to pay much higher fares than passengers on publicly-owned railways in Europe. Jeremy Corbyn has restated his commitment to delivering an affordable railway under public ownership that puts people before profit. Read more about it here.

Join us to protest against the #RailRipOff at stations around the UK on Monday 4 January 2016. Find the nearest protest to you below. All you need to do is turn up as other activists will be there with leaflets and information for you to distribute to passengers. Please make sure to post updates and photos on social media using the hashtags #RailRipOff and #Momentum.

""I joined Momentum after spending my summer campaigning for Jeremy Corbyn to become Leader of the Labour Party. I'd never met so many like-minded young people in one place before. For the first time in my life, I felt like we had a say in our future. There was so much energy and enthusiasm in the campaign that we needed to find a way to harness it.
 
Momentum gives me a place to explore new ideas and a platform to express myself. It makes me feel hopeful that we can change things for the better so that we don't end up worse off than our parents. Since joining Momentum I've discovered a whole community of people I never knew existed who share my beliefs and want to make a difference to society.

There's been a great spirit during the Christmas period: of families coming together and communities supporting each other, helping out neighbours, helping the homeless, helping out victims of floods in so many parts of the country.

It's that spirit of community and solidarity we need to bring into the heart of our politics and the way our country is run.

I was elected Leader of the Labour Party in September on a mandate for change.

During these last three months, we've challenged this Government ‚Äì and defeated them: on Working Tax Credits, cuts to the police service, and running the prison service in Saudi Arabia.

We will have to challenge them even more next year ‚Äì on their damaging cuts to public services, and their lack of investment in our economy and our people.

But we will also offer a real alternative: a politics that gives people a say in the decisions that affect them, and an economy based on long-term investment, instead of self-defeating austerity.

We want to build an economy fit for the 21st century.

2016 will be the start of a journey to elect a Labour government in 2020 that will do just that: a government that will deliver a fairer, more prosperous society that we can all enjoy ‚Äì a society that works for all, not just the few.""

""Because the UK government hid and delayed the publication of the statistics, academic researchers in England have been forced to use data passed to the European Statistical Office. That data shows that George Osborne mislead parliament in his March 2015 claim when he said that people were better-off than they had been in 2010. Data collected across the whole of the UK actually revealed that living standards had fallen for all but the very richest. Increasing numbers of people have been reporting falling behind with their rent and that they are struggling to pay fuel bills. Almost half the population cannot now afford to immediately repair or replace their fridge or cooker if it breaks down. ""Only the very richest (those who could make ends meet very easily) saw no perceived fall in their living standards.""

Living in a society that tolerates gross wealth and income inequalities makes it hard to empathize with a wide range of other people. The very rich may ignore you in the same way that you sometimes don't notice the person sweeping the street as you walk by. Or the very rich try not to notice you ‚Äì just as you might have learnt to try not to notice the people sleeping rough in the entrance to the tube or train or bus station. You are as far down, and your life as frightening to the very rich, as the thought of being roofless will be to you.""

155710354774360_191880891157306,"Seasons Greetings and End of Year Reflections from Momentum.

As Christmas is upon us, we'd like to wish you a happy, healthy and peaceful festive period. 

It has certainly been an exciting and unforgettable year. In less than three months, Momentum has exploded on to the political scene. Thousands of people have attended local meetings and events, engaged through social media or got stuck in to campaigns. But this is just the beginning. There is a lot of work to be done in 2016 to ensure that Momentum continues to develop into a sustainable and democratic organisation with increased participation from the grassroots. As 2015 draws to a close, we'd like to take this opportunity to reflect on what we have achieved, outline our intentions for 2016 and express our sincere thanks to you for being part of this movement. 
 
Momentum launched shortly after Jeremy's victory, with the first priority being to capture the energy and enthusiasm which his campaign sparked. Within 24 hours, Momentum had over 12,000 likes on Facebook. All around the UK, Momentum supporters started to organise meetings and gatherings in their local areas, bringing together the young and old, seasoned Labour Party activists, trade unionists, community organisers along with people who had never been involved in politics before. 

This explosion of energy meant that Momentum could begin running national campaigns in support of Jeremy in his first few months of leadership. In just two months, thousands of Momentum volunteers have been involved in numerous campaigns and activities, such as: 

- Democracy SOS. Momentum's first campaign was a mass voter registration drive to lessen the impact of government changes that could see up to two million people drop off the electoral register. 150,000 leaflets were distributed by Momentum activists at events all around the UK.
- No Work Penalty. As part of the successful campaign against George Osborne's tax credit cuts, Momentum collected 'Dear George' messages about how people would be personally affected. These were watched, 'liked' and shared by tens of thousands of people on social media.
- Oldham by-election. Momentum helped mobilise people from across the UK, including organising coaches from five cities to transport activists to canvass for a Labour win in the Oldham West and Royton by-election. Jim McMahon won the seat with an increased share of the vote and thanked Momentum for the support. Hopefully, this will be the first of many election victories for the Corbyn-led Labour Party.
- Don't Bomb Syria. Over 30,000 supporters used the Momentum lobby tool to email their MPs asking them to vote against the bombing in Syria ‚Äì as two-thirds of Labour MPs were persuaded to do. 
- Justice for Climate and Jobs. Momentum helped mobilise supporters to join the largest worldwide environmental demonstration in the run up to the Paris Conference.

On Monday 4 January, Momentum supporters all around the UK will be calling for the railways to be brought back into public ownership to end the #RailFareRipOff. Look out for the email in the next few days for details of the events closest to you.

In addition to the national campaigns, there have been lots of inspiring stories from the local groups: from voter registration drives at football matches in Brighton, to organising campaigning workshops in Gateshead and Blaydon. Momentum's greatest asset is the wealth of knowledge, experience and energy of its grassroots supporters. Share your best practice with us at celebrate@peoplesmomentum.com. We'll be sharing your stories within the network in a monthly newsletter in the new year.

While Momentum has successfully achieved its initial short term goal of capturing the energy and enthusiasm of Jeremy's campaign, there is still work to be done to ensure that it meets its longer term aim of developing into a democratic, transparent and participatory organisation. 

When Momentum was launched, the website stated, ""As it grows, Momentum will develop democratic governance structures at every level of the network."" This will be the top priority for early 2016. We will continue to establish regional coordinating networks, made up of two representatives from local groups, at least one of whom must be a woman. In order to move towards a democratic governance structure at a national level, a National Committee will meet in January 2016. Its initial composition is to be decided by the Launch Reference Group (Clive Lewis MP, Rebecca Long-Bailey MP, Richard Burgon MP, Kate Osamor MP, Jon Lansman and Cllr. Sam Tarry), and full details will be published on the website. 

In order to reflect the diversity of the movement and its grassroots nature, the National Committee will be made up of two representatives from Scotland, Wales and each of the nine English regions, two from each national trade union and representatives of established Labour left organisations. The committee will be gender balanced and will include BAME and disability representation. Initial representation from regions and nations and equalities groups will be based on consultation as prescribed by the reference group, but will be elected within six months.

The National Committee will perform the following functions:
- Engage with supporters to listen to what groups need to be able to organise effectively at a local level.
- In consultation with local groups and supporters, create a democratic, representative structure which facilitates local, regional and national coordination.
- Ensure that Momentum has the capacity to hold free and fair elections for positions on the National Committee.
- Clarify a membership and affiliation structure, and encourage trade union participation at local and regional as well as national level.
- Secure a viable pathway for Momentum to become a financially sustainable organisation.
- Ensure all the necessary organisational processes and procedures are in place (for instance, verification for local groups and complaints procedures).

Full details of the National Committee will be published on the website. Momentum supporters will receive regular updates on the process, and every effort will be made to engage grassroots supporters in the decision-making processes. We are confident that this process will ensure that Momentum will become a sustainable organisation which will be able to facilitate a grassroots movement for real progressive change in our communities. 

As Jeremy outlines in his endorsement of Momentum, 2015 has been a remarkable year. But this is just the beginning. Thank you for your continued support and for being part of Momentum.  

With festive greetings,

""As a father of two, I want my children to have the same chances that I had: access to public healthcare and education, free at the point of use, and to have access to social housing. These social virtues and public goods that we took for granted are now being whittled away, to an extent that I can now see a future where my children will have less opportunities that my generation had.
 
As a small business owner, I am sick and tired of the uneven playing field, where multinational corporations pay less taxes proportionately than small businesses like myself. I was inspired by Jeremy Corbyn's call to look after small business owners such as myself through a just and transparent tax system.
 
I see Momentum as a vehicle to change the narrative and the direction our society is heading, and revive the idea of a virtue-lead politics for the common good. This is done on a local level, addressing local concerns, by challenging social cleansing and preserving communal amenities. Nationally, we should be challenging dogmas of the status quo and participating in national campaigns such as voter registration and tax justice.
 
Momentum resurrects the ideal of individuals coming together, inspired by values and ideas to change society for the good. Each small act of collective social good, hopefully creates a virtuous cycle, leading to a transformation of society.""

""...in history events rarely quite replicate themselves. For a start, however acute Labour's fractures are today they pale in comparison with the early 1980s, when rival factions tore into each other with gusto, virulence and venom.

...Further, the late-1970s and early-1980s was a period of severe and unprecedented polarisation which featured rival, solidly-structured blocs of left and right releasing salvos at each other with little regard for the party's popular standing. This simple binary distinction does not begin to do justice to the complexities, subtleties and nuances of modern Labour politics.""

I believe that this movement is something new to the UK and in that way, it can create history. Asides from the obvious 2020 election victory, I want to see Momentum as the vanguard of positive social change that the UK has been crying out for ever since I was born and for long before that too.

""In the season of peace and goodwill to ALL - The UK's political establishment begin yet another WAR. 

Momentum thanks all sisters and brothers who lobbied so hard to persuade their MPs to vote Against Cameron's war and to support Jeremy Corbyn. We succeeded in encouraging most Brum MPs to vote against war but were not so successful in the Black Country.

This meeting will be a forum to discuss the next steps - in building a mass social movement for #ANewKindOfPolitics and in democratising the Labour Party in Birmingham & the Black Country.

We hope to sketch out our campaigning priorities for 2016 and begin to focus on a #2020Vision for victory.""

""The whole Labour family came to Oldham in the course of the campaign: the leader of the Scottish Labour Kezia Dugdale; Members of Parliament; councillors and activists from all over the country. There were also four coach loads of supporters from Momentum, who Jim McMahon thanked for their positive contribution.

London based commentators and MPs took pleasure in claiming that the by-election was a ""referendum"" on Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn. They said confidently that the majority would drop or we could even lose. Well, if it was a referendum on the new leader, it was one he won handsomely. Not only did we win in Oldham, but we won with an increased share of the vote.

The combination of an excellent local candidate and Labour's clear campaign messages led to this result. As Jeremy Corbyn put it, Jim McMahon ""ran a great campaign, focusing on bringing jobs to Oldham and giving every child the best opportunities"" and the result was ""a clear demonstration that Labour is the party working people trust.""""

""The reason for all this outpouring of distortion, lies and insults is simple. Momentum is founded on an enthusiasm, felt by hundreds of thousands of people, for a new and genuine left and a rejection of the failed Westminster consensus. It therefore has the potential to pose one of the most serious threats to the British establishment it has ever experienced.

...It is in the interests of Labour's right to confine political debate and the expression of political ideas to parliament, where the left is heavily outnumbered. Momentum provides the vehicle by which the will of the mass membership can be voiced and brought to bear.""

""The campaign against the trade union bill is at a critical stage. The parliamentary process has moved into the House of Lords, where we have our best chances of defeating it or getting changes pushed through.

But this means ensuring the bill remains in the public eye as much as possible. We need to remind politicians and journalists alike of the vital role unions and union members play in our society and economy.

In February (from the 8th to 14th) we'll be staging a special week of action against the trade union bill throughout England and Wales.  A week that takes the message to more and more people, union members or not, that this bill is bad for our country.

When I visit workplaces throughout the UK, I'm always amazed by the great work being done by union reps to train, educate and look after their colleagues.

Over the last decade alone trade union learning centres have provided courses for over two million learners and helped develop over 30,000 learning reps. Government research from 2007 estimated union reps prevent up to 13,000 accidents a year, and by providing a voice for the workforce, reduce conflict and staff turnover, saving hundreds of millions of pounds.

Improving the lives of workers and communities is what unions are about.

Now is the time to share with others the great work unions and reps do where you work and live. We want to know why you heartunions.

heartunions is a chance to showcase the difference that unions make in your area. If you know of a union rep, course or programme that you think needs celebrating then we want to hear from you.

Wherever you work, be it a hospital, factory or call centre, please get involved, and get in touch with your stories.

Loads of events are being planned for the week. On Tuesday the 9th, the TUC we'll be hosting the biggest ever workplace meeting, linking branches across the country to highlight the vital work unions do in workplaces of all types. On Thursday the 11th, we'll be taking the message out into our communities, and calling on you to help raise the profile of trade unions where you live, and recruit more members to our movement.

All the key information about the week of action will be at heartunions.org.  We'll keep adding to it in the coming weeks so that it will have everything you need to take part.

Let's show the government that threatening trade unions has no place in a modern democracy. Only through coming together and showing our united strength will we be able defend the right to strike and organise together.""

First of all a big thank you for setting up the Momentum Facebook pages round the country. The first two months of Momentum have seen us grow to over ninety local groups with many thousands of supporters and this is down to you and your fellow campaigners who have worked so hard.

As we grow Momentum into the force for social change that we all know it can be, we want to collect evidence of all the great things that are happening under the Momentum banner up and down the country. Many of you are doing a great job of posting on the Momentum Facebook page but I am equally sure that some brilliant things are happening that we don't know about!

It would be really great to know about all the things you have done so far - we will then produce a monthly Newsletter highlighting some of the great work around the country. This will give us a chance to celebrate each others achievements and hopefully inspire each other to try some new and greater things!

To help you keep track of quantitative data, (how many meetings, how many people attended etc) I am attaching a spreadsheet you can use. Please try and keep this up to date so that you have evidence of what you and your group have done. 

There is a questionnaire which we'd like you to fill in. Please email celebratemomentum@gmail.com and we'll send you a copy. This is an opportunity for you to share your successes and also things you have learned or that haven't worked so well. Do also feel free to send us photographs, quotes from members of the public, anything that will really give a picture of how things are going.

I would be really really grateful if I could have your questionnaire by end of Frday the 11th December. This would mean that we can get a Newsletter out before Christmas.

I can't wait to find out what you've all been up to!

Thanks,
Rebecca

155710354774360_184062578605804,"It has always been our intention to be an outward facing group. That's entirely in keeping with the Corbyn leadership campaign over the summer, which reached out to people who had become disillusioned with mainstream politics and the lack of a coherent alternative on the left.

Momentum sprang out of a desire to help empower people previously not politicised, to encourage those people to engage in debate and to organise on issues which affect them in their communities. So we think that it's right for Momentum to be seeking to work with coalitions and campaigning groups outside the Labour Party, nationally and locally. 

What we will not allow, however, and we don't think our supporters will accept, is for our grassroots network to be used as a vehicle for other groups to push their party agendas, which have for decades been set against the Labour Party and those members who have worked hard to get us to this position.

155710354774360_183721225306606,"A fairly decent write up of Momentum's role from the Spectator of all places. Sebastian Payne interviewed Momentum organiser Emma Rees up in Oldham last Saturday: 

""The question that still puzzled me is why does Momentum exist as a separate organisation from the Labour party? There are the traditional party structures, which offer plenty of opportunities for campaigning ‚Äî regardless of whether you support Corbyn or not. I spoke to Emma Rees, one of the Momentum organisers for the Oldham campaign day about what the group is doing. Rees said Saturday was 'a real show of strength and solidarity'. Despite the 'absolutely abysmal weather', Momentum did similar things to regular Labour activists: leafleting, posting letters and making tea.

So what is the point of Momentum if it is doing the same things as Labour? 'Momentum is about providing an additional platform for people to get involved and to participate in politics at a local level with the idea of strengthening the Labour party and working towards a Labour victory in 2020 and all the other elections,' Rees said. 'The vast majority of Momentum supporters are active members of their local Labour parties and many Momentum supporters are people who have also newly joined the party'.

Like McDonnell, Rees denied that Momentum is trying to be a party within Labour ‚Äî insisting the group only exists to help. 'The experience on the ground really doesn't speak to that. I think you have consider that Momentum has come out of the back of a leadership campaign that was incredibly positive and it involved lots of people ‚Äì there were 16,000 people that volunteered during Jeremy's leadership campaign and Momentum is continuation that'.""

155710354774360_183112845367444,"Lies, distortions and misconceptions about Momentum and the lobbying of MPs:

""Following the Syria debate on Wednesday and the prior lobbying and demonstrations, media descriptions of the abuse and bullying tactics directed at MPs reached a crescendo. Thursday's Daily Mail, for example, under a double-page headline ""hard-left hate mob target MPs"", carried a picture purporting to show them outside the home of Stella Creasy, MP for Walthamstow with the caption ""Menacing: protesters against air-strikes marching last night outside the home of pro-war MP"". The Daily Mirror reported that ""Hundreds, including vicars and imams, marched on Stella Creasy's  constituency base"". As the Guardian reported this morning, many other media outlets not to mention social media ran with the story.

It is perhaps not surprising in this context that on the BBC Today programme Friday morning, Tom Watson warned that any Labour members who joined an anti-war protest outside the home of the Labour MP Stella Creasy should be thrown out of the party. Except that there was no protest outside her home. Stella Creasy confirmed that the protest had not gone past her home at all.

Tom Watson's comments were reasonably measured (""They look like a bit of a rabble to me but I don't think they are particularly a problem for the Labour party"") but his comments unwittingly contributed to the false image which is being created of Momentum. 

....There are many factors that appear to have contributed to distorted coverage, misrepresentation and downright lies including:

- agents provocateurs on social media, hiding behind fake identities, who may be Tories or perhaps even Labour members engaged in 'black ops';

- hostile or opportunistic members of other parties like Nancy Taafe of the Socialist Party who stood against Stella Creasy in May (winning 394 votes for TUSC, good for them but, at less than 1%, an utterly pathetic vote for anyone who lives in the real world) but goes on BBC Daily Politics to demand her deselection;

- exaggerated claims by hard right Labour MPs determined to discredit Momentum and Jeremy Corbyn.

However, there undoubtedly are also some people, probably a small number, who think of themselves as being supportive of Jeremy Corbyn and against war in Syria who are guilty of inappropriate behaviour towards MPs ‚Äì using inappropriate language or photos, abuse, intimidation and even bullying. Many will not be members of Momentum or the Labour Party""

Critical articles and interviews had been lined up, about the future of Labour under Jeremy Corbyn, after a predicted narrow, pyrrhic victory for his party or even a surprise Ukip win in the Oldham West and Royton byelection. Even the relatively supportive Daily Mirror had assumed the worst in its print edition, with an overnight article headlined ""Dark night of the polls for Jeremy"".

So, yes, they did get an upset. But it certainly wasn't the one they were expecting. Labour won the first byelection of Corbyn's leadership with an increased 62% share of the vote. Second-placed Ukip, who spent the month-long campaign being talked up, received just 23%. Oldham gave Labour a big win.

When you look at the facts and not the fevered speculation, you can see Labour had a strong local candidate in Jim McMahon. It also ran a well-organised campaign that gathered support from all wings of the party.""

""I just want to set the record straight for anyone reading or listening to the news about Walthamstow and Stella Creasy, which as far as I can tell is totally untrue. 

On Tuesday a local resident Sophie Bolt and Rev Steven Saxby organised a family vigil, which myself and others helped to publicise quickly on social media. No one asked me to do it, I just did it. 

It was a beautiful, calm meet-up of for anyone who wanted to show our MP Stella Creasy that we wanted her to vote NO on air strikes in Syria. We met at the Queen's Road mosque with candles in jam jars and walked quietly to Stella's Labour office on Orford Road, where there were speeches by religious and community leaders. 

It was a beautiful, community, inspiring family event of people trying to make their voices heard against the airstrikes and trying to influence Stella, even though we knew she was in Westminster. 

We took post-it notes and thought it would be powerful to write messages of peace and stick them on the office window. It looked beautiful and powerful. 

The next day we realised someone had put up a Facebook post with a picture of the start of the vigil, which was outside the mosque. You can see the mosque on the right if you zoom in, but mostly it's just the houses next to it. He claimed we were outside Stella's house and said something incendiary about her not having children to worry about. (His exact post was: 'outside [her] house... apparently she has still to make up her mind ‚Äì and she has no children to upset'.) He managed to get some police in the pic which made it look like a demo and it was dark and blurry. In fact the very low police presence were very helpful and friendly throughout.""

""Momentum is disappointed that Parliament voted for Syrian airstrikes last night. We do not believe that David Cameron made the case that bombs will defeat Daesh or improve the lives and security of Syrians, the UK or our allies, and we fear that they may have the opposite effect.

Nevertheless, we are pleased that the majority of Labour MPs and the shadow cabinet did oppose David Cameron's proposal, reflecting the policy of the party conference and the wishes of its members. We also respect and acknowledge the right of all MPs to vote as they have done.

Members of the Labour Party and the public have a right to be heard. Momentum is proud that we assisted over 30,000 people to email their MP asking them not to vote for bombing. We believe these messages from the public helped convince some of the 153 Labour and 72 non-Labour MPs who voted against bombing to do so. It can never be a threat to express your views to your elected representative.

Momentum strongly disapproves of anyone who engages in abusive behaviour towards MPs or anyone else, and threatening or bullying, whether they are outside the Labour Party (as most are) or inside it. We specifically asked our supporters to emulate Jeremy Corbyn, and to keep their messages about the issues and to refrain from any personal attacks.

Momentum is not a threat to MPs who voted for bombing. We have made clear that we will not campaign for the deselection of any MP and will not permit any local Momentum groups to do so. The selection of candidates is entirely a matter for local party members and rightly so.""",,status,,2015-12-03 11:32:02,544,105,168,544,0,0,0,0,0

- A comprehensive EU-wide plan to provide humanitarian assistance to the consequent increase in the number of refugees ‚Äì but in fact, the EU refugee plan is unravelling and the approach to refugees is increasingly fragmented.
- That bombing is exclusively directed at military targets directly associated with ISIL ‚Äì but there is no guarantee that the population of areas currently controlled by ISIL would be protected.
- That any military action is subordinated to international diplomatic efforts, including the main regional powers, to end the Syrian civil war ‚Äì but unfortunately the shooting down of a Russian plane by Turkey on top of differing approaches to the Assad regime and continuing ethno-religious conflict make a broadly-based, sovereign Syrian government that could retake territory currently controlled by ISIL a diminishing prospect.",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/PeoplesMomentum/photos/a.160217227657006.1073741829.155710354774360/182057835472945/?type=3,2015-12-02 10:06:50,401,18,111,401,0,0,0,0,0

Let's develop the energy and enthusiasm of the Jeremy's campaign to enrich our democracy and build a better Labour Party.

Throughout the Labour leadership campaign, Jeremy often spoke about building a social movement to work for a more democratic, equal and decent society. Now is the time to make this a reality.

How will Momentum do this?

- Organise events, rallies, meet ups and policy consultations to encourage mass mobilisation for a more democratic, equal and decent society.
- Encourage those inspired by Jeremy Corbyn's campaign to get involved with the Labour Party, and to take its radical new message into their communities and workplaces. 
- Assist members in making their voice heard in Labour Party debates.
- Help people to build new and support existing organisations that can make concrete improvements now to people's lives. 

Through these actions, we aim to demonstrate on a micro level how collective action and Labour values can transform our society for the better.

Just like Jeremy's leadership campaign, Momentum will not receive large corporate funding. We are the People's Movement. Therefore, Momentum will rely on many generous donations from ordinary people, just like you. Please help our grassroots network to grow and reach out to as many people as possible.

Together, we can create the more democratic, equal and decent society we all deserve:

As many of you will know, Peter is a well know Conservative Party supporter, commentator and newspaper columnist. Say it quietly, but he's even been known to write for the Daily Mail. Nevertheless Peter was outraged by the Tories' #WorkPenalty - a testament to the sheer foolishness of this policy and wanted to record this video for Momentum. This is what he said:

""I'm terribly upset and worried by the work penalty - your changes to tax credits, which seem to me to invidiously penalise working poor people. You've done a lot for the rich, it's time you looked after the working poor."" 

So, it's a case of #NoWorkPenalty - at least in name, but as many people have pointed out, not only has George Osborne already found other ways to channel these brutal cuts (into housing benefit cuts, slashing Universal Credit or cutting grants to student nurses, for example), but there is a wider package of cuts which are already devastating communities up and down the country - and that pain will simply continue and intensify. So we've decided not to abandon our #DearGeorge campaign. We'll continue it, but widen the remit, explaining that Austerity Isn't Working - and asking people to personalise the cuts with videos and messages in that theme. Look out for more details soon. 

It isn't ""job done"", but a small win on the way to much bigger ones. But one good thing: we've got the #Momentum",,video,https://www.facebook.com/PeoplesMomentum/videos/179473485731380/,2015-11-25 15:52:42,158,9,35,158,0,0,0,0,0

Floods, typhoons and droughts are already impacting many millions of people, both here and abroad. This humanitarian crisis affects those who have done least to create the problem the most, and left unchecked would affect us all.

But since May the Tories have systematically dismantled some of the most important environment policies- from blocking wind power, cutting support for solar and ending programmes to insulate cold homes. Instead they are going all out for fossil fuels.

We're marching to say: 

‚óè No to dirty energy!

‚óè Yes to renewables!

‚óè Climate jobs now!

‚óè Justice for people!

Momentum will be marching with the Labour Party bloc ‚Äì join us by the momentum banner at MEETING POINT J ON PARK LANE 

A map and more info is here: http://bit.ly/1S4hioZ 

All over the world people are already putting into practice real solutions: public renewable energy, green infrastructure, millions of new, unionised clean jobs. But it needs to happen faster, at scale and with people at its centre.

With such solutions already in flow, we can leave the age of fossil fuels behind. Some choices we can each make on our own. But some, we as a society must make together.

Hope is with people who are already way ahead of those governments who lack the political will to act, and ahead of those corporate interests who are blocking the changes we need.

Together, we are more powerful than they could possibly imagine. Whatever happens in the Paris climate talks, we can, and we will, build the future from here. A more just, more equitable and better world for us all.

On the 1st of December, an estimated 1.9 million people are set to drop off the electoral register because of the government's introduction of 'individual electoral registration'.

In the past, one person could register on everyone's behalf, government changes mean that each individual needs to register themselves. Many won't.

Another 8 million people are already missing from the register. That's almost 1 in 5 adults without the vote. That's not democracy.

Who is this most likely to affect?

- Young people (only 25% of 17-year-olds are on the register)
- Students
- People in temporary or shared housing
- People who are new to the country.

""I spoke to student and Birmingham resident Rachael Harris, the founder of Birmingham Momentum. I first met her over the summer; she was one of the hardest workers in my phone banking team for the Jeremy Corbyn for Labour Leader campaign, often working from home due to the limited hours we had at the Unite Union offices.

In launching the Birmingham Momentum group, Harris has taken on a leadership role, as well as a great deal of responsibility. She doesn't see herself as a natural leader, stressing, ""I put myself forward because nobody else seemed to.""

I point out that people often say the same of Corbyn: that he accepted he had to run for leadership in order for his values to be represented, rather than out of a desire for power and prestige. While she is the leader, she says she wants, ""everybody to take an important and active role and for everybody to feel equally valued"", echoing the ethos of Corbyn's leadership of the Labour party.""

Now it's time to ensure that Oldham West and Royton remains a Labour seat and that Jim McMahon, the leader of Oldham Council and Labour's candidate, is elected to serve the constituency.

Over the summer, we proved how powerful we can be when we come together around a common aim. It's time to prove it again. This is the first election during Jeremy's leadership and UKIP is the next biggest contender. It is crucial that we demonstrate that Jeremy's Labour Party is serious about winning elections and delivering the more democratic, equal and decent society we all deserve.

Next Saturday, 28th November, Momentum supporters from around the country will head to Oldham West and Royton to show grassroots support for the Labour Party by canvassing for Jim McMahon's victory over UKIP.

Can you help to cover the travel costs? We want to demonstrate the strength of our support for Jeremy's Labour Party by helping as many volunteers as possible to travel to Oldham West and Royton to canvass for Labour and secure a victory for Jim McMahon.

I can chip in to cover travel costs:

https://momentum.nationbuilder.com/donate?utm_campaign=oldham_elects&utm_medium=email&utm_source=momentum

What will we be doing?

We will help coordinate travel as much as possible so that Momentum supporters can travel together, either by coaches from big cities or by putting you in touch with others in your area who are also travelling at the same time.

Momentum supporters will meet up in the morning and head to the Labour Party office in Oldham to join the team.

We'll spend the day canvassing with the Labour Party
Early evening, we'll have a social gathering so that we can meet each other and relax after a good day's canvassing.

I want to campaign for Labour in Oldham West and Royton:

The Labour Party are hard at work and campaigning every day. Can you campaign for Labour on another day, especially polling day, Thursday 3 December? The Labour Campaign Centre is at 227 Middleton Road, Chadderton, Oldham, OL9 6LR and is open from 9.30am ‚Äì 7pm. Scheduled campaign sessions start at 10am, 1.30pm, 3.30pm and 5.30pm. For queries, please contact Liam on 07703716830 or Noel on 07843 344319.

If you aren't able to campaign directly to elect Jim McMahon and defeat UKIP - or even if you are - can you help fund the cause?

I can donate to Labour's campaign:

Changes to the electoral system mean almost two million people are about to drop off the electoral register, without realising it.
Democracy SOS is an urgent voter registration campaign by Momentum.

The facts

-An estimated 1.9million people are set to drop off the electoral register because of the government's introduction of 'individual electoral registration'.
- In the past, one person could register on everyone's behalf, government changes mean that each individual needs to register themselves. Many won't.
- Another 8 million people are already missing from the register.
- That's almost 1 in 5 adults without the vote. That's not democracy
.
Who is this most likely to affect?

- Young people (only 25% of 17-year-olds are on the register)
- Students
- People in temporary or shared housing
- People who are new to the country

Why it matters

- This is important not only because we have hugely important elections coming up in May 2016 in Scotland, London, Wales, and many English councils, but also because it will have a significant effect on the 2020 general election by reducing the representation of poorer areas.
-Before the next general election, the Boundary Commission will redraw constituency boundaries. The Commission will do this based on who is on the electoral register on 1 December this year.
- Areas where more people fail to register will get fewer seats. Labour will lose seats and the Tories will gain, which is why they are doing it.

Momentum is calling on people to organise events, rallies and stalls to encourage people to register to vote. We are working alongside local Labour Party activists and others - so check out if there's an event near you. If you are organising a local voter registration drive feel free to add it to our map:

155710354774360_175441129467949,"George Osborne wants to inflict a Work Penalty on three million households. Through cuts to tax credits, the Tories plan to take an average of ¬£1300 per year away from these working families.

The government's plans have provoked outrage and uproar across the land. Even the comment pages of the Financial Times called the cuts a ""crime and a blunder"". Labour MPs stood up and voted against this Work Penalty in Parliament (read the party's six reasons why here). The House of Lords refused to vote through the legislation in the face of threats that the government would appoint 100 new unelected Lords to force through the Work Penalty.

On 25 November, Osborne will set out his response to this opposition in his Autumn Statement in Parliament. We have to keep the pressure up and fight against this unjust Work Penalty. To do so, more people need to hear from those affected by the policy. Michelle Dorrell's personal contribution on Question Time did so much more to explain the cruelty and dishonesty of the Work Penalty than abstract figures. These are working people's lives that this government is choosing to make worse. 

We must also mobilise in the streets against this needless, callous policy that will push 200,000 children into poverty.

155710354774360_174719232873472,"Andrew Gilligan's ""investigation"" into Momentum in the Sunday Telegraph of Sunday 8 November contains a number of inaccuracies and innuendo about Momentum. It misrepresents Momentum's handling of data as possibly illegal, through quoting unnamed sources.

The article first introduces Momentum's data management with the following paragraph:

""Momentum has harvested thousands of confidential personal records of Labour members, including their private emails and telephone numbers, and is already using them to operate phonebanks, it can be disclosed. The tactic has caused a major row, with Momentum's opponents claiming it is illegal under data protection laws.""

The suggestion that Momentum has done anything improper is false.

The legal entity that holds and manages Momentum's data is Momentum Campaign Ltd. This company was previously called Jeremy Corbyn Campaign 2015 (Supporters) Limited which, during the Labour Leadership campaign, operated the Corbyn's campaign's website and managed its data. 

The only data that Momentum holds is data obtained with the express and active permission of the individuals concerned (""explicit consent"", as the Data Protection Act 1998 puts it). The campaign website featured a privacy policy which, among other things, stated that the campaign was: 

""collecting this data for use in Jeremy's campaign and to build a lasting network of support and debate around the ideas it inspires. It will be used to help us provide you with information to match your interests. We may also use it to alert you of activities you may be interested in and events happening in your area now and in the future.""

---

Later in the article, Gilligan quotes an unnamed councillor in Leeds who calls Momentum's contacting of local members and constituency officials ""illegal"".

""Mr Benn opposes Mr Corbyn's policies on the EU and Trident. Moderate activists in Leeds told the Telegraph that Momentum had already started lobbying members and constituency officials using private contact details supplied to the Labour Party. 'There will be complaints about this,' said one councillor. 'It is illegal and a serious breach of privacy.' ""

Momentum has not lobbied members of Leeds Central Constituency Labour Party (CLP) on the EU, Trident or indeed any other issue. No specific emails have been sent to supporters of Momentum in Leeds Central nor indeed elsewhere in Leeds. Supporters of Momentum in Leeds have received three emails: two making national announcements sent to all supporters, and one sent to supporters in Yorkshire and the Humber informing them of local group development and details of a voter registration drives.

The contact details of our supporters in Leeds, as elsewhere, were gained through the explicit consent of those individuals themselves during or after the leadership campaign.

Momentum did email some constituency parties (CLPs) to inform them of the group's Democracy SOS voter registration campaign and to offer support to any voter registration activities CLPs were planning. The contact details of CLP secretaries were either in the public domain or supplied to us by supporters in those constituencies. The email to secretaries was not ""lobbying"" but information about our activities and an offer to support their activities on the vital issue of voter registration. 

The contact details of CLPs' secretaries were processed fairly and lawfully. CLP secretaries were contacted to further the legitimate interest of Momentum in working more closely with CLPs to encourage voter registration. It is absurd to suggest that groups of Labour Party members like Momentum cannot contact Constituency Labour Parties in relation to campaigns by Labour Party members in those constituencies. CLP secretaries would reasonably expect to be contacted in relation to such activities.

---

The article later quotes another anonymous source who claims Momentum's data handling is illegal.

""Party sources said Mr Lansman is locked in dispute with Labour officials over the ownership of this personal information, including hundreds of thousands of telephone numbers, emails and addresses, given by Labour to the Corbyn campaign so it could canvass during the leadership election.

""Data protection law is clear,"" said one source. ""You cannot pass personal information given to one organisation, the Labour Party, for one purpose to a completely different organisation, Momentum, for a different purpose.""

However, Momentum has already conducted at least one full phone-banking session, on October 12, using the ""illegal"" information. It says it is entitled to hold it as the official ""successor"" to the Corbyn campaign. A spokesman for the Data Protection Registrar said no complaint had yet been received, but confirmed that Momentum was not registered to hold personal information, as the law requires.""

Momentum is not ""locked in dispute"" with Labour officials over its data. Momentum was asked to clarify its data handling and it has done so.

Contrary to the suggestion by the unnamed source, Momentum has not used Labour Party data supplied to Jeremy Corbyn for the purpose of the leadership campaign. The only information retained by Jeremy Corbyn Campaign 2015 (Supporters) Limited (now Momentum Campaign Ltd) following the end of the leadership campaign is a fresh dataset obtained through the explicit consent of the data subjects.  The campaign's privacy policy expressly distinguished between data supplied by the Party and data shared voluntarily with the campaign. It has been reported that other campaigns pursued similar privacy policies, with other campaigns' data now available to Labour First.

155710354774360_174273689584693,"Remember the date: the 1st of December - on that date, up to 1.9 million people are due to drop off the electoral register because of individualised voter registration:

This matters for two major reasons - not only because we have hugely important elections coming up in May 2016 in Scotland, London, Wales, and many English councils, but also because it will have a significant effect on the 2020 general election by reducing the representation of poorer areas.

Before the next general election, the Boundary Commission will redraw constituency boundaries. The Commission will do this based on who is on the electoral register on 1 December this year.

Areas where more people fail to register will get fewer seats. Labour will lose seats and the Tories will gain, which is why they are doing it.

Momentum will be campaigning hard to raise awareness of this and to register people via street stalls and events. Please let us know if you have anything going on locally - and add your event to the map below:

The Trade Union Bill...will deliberately curtail the ability of any worker to fight for equal pay, fair treatment and against discrimination and harassment. It could move the cause of women's rights back decades.

Large parts of it apply to everyone - heavily policed pickets, strikes being broken by hiring agency staff, and attacks on union finances, both political and otherwise. But the nastiest legislation is reserved for those working in ""important"" public services. Workers in these sectors will see the ways they pay union fees stopped. The time they can spend negotiating with employers will be restricted. And to go on strike they will have to achieve levels of votes far above the level received by most governments.

TUC data reveals that almost three quarters of the union members affected by those most oppressive rules are women.""

""Somewhere deep inside the Treasury building on London's Whitehall, there's a gang of Tory advisers working around the clock with just one aim: pull George Osborne out of the fire on Tax Credits.

The Chancellor thought he got away with it this Summer, when he announced cuts to Social Security.

However, Government attempts to re-brand Tax Credits for working families as welfare 'bribes' has backfired spectacularly, with even Tories demanding a u-turn on cuts that will take ¬£1,300 away from 3 million households.

According to leaks out of Iain Duncan Smith's DWP, the latest wheeze being considered by the Treasury is to bury the cuts within the black-box of Universal Credit.

When this new system comes in, it will roll up multiple measures that support people in work, like Tax Credits, so the Chancellor thinks he can try and hide his tax credit cuts by confusing people.

Leaving aside the question of whether Universal Credit, which has seen its costs rise by ¬£3bn and slipped years behind schedule, will ever be properly rolled out - this plan would be a total con.

It will still create a work penalty for families, but simply push the cuts a little further down the line.""

155710354774360_171372073208188,"Thousands of students and their allies marched through central London yesterday to call for free education, voicing opposition to Tory cuts and tuition fees. Momentum, the grassroots network arising out of the Jeremy Corbyn for Labour Leader campaign, attended the demonstration to express solidarity with students struggling for a more equal, democratic and decent society.

Momentum's first national campaign, Democracy SOS, targets the scandal of an estimated 1.9 million people dropping off the electoral register following government changes to electoral registration. Students are disproportionately affected, as their university or college are no longer able to register on their behalf. Tory plans to insist that boundary changes for the 2020 general election are calculated on the basis of this reduced electoral roll as it stands on 1 December 2015 compound the iniquity. Poorer and student areas will receive less representation than richer areas as the Boundary Commission will be forced to assume that those who have dropped off the electoral register do not exist.

At today's demonstration, which was organised by the National Campaign against Fees and Cuts, Momentum helped students register to vote. The group also distributed leaflets raising awareness of the changes to voter registration and the need to get registered before the end of November. 

Adam Klug, a Momentum organiser, explained, ""Lots of people don't know if they'll drop off the register or not. If in any doubt, you can do it from your computer or smartphone in five minutes at www.gov.uk/register-to-vote. All you need is your name, address, date of birth and National Insurance number.""

After pledging to register to vote, Jas Odusanya, a 19 year-old student of International Development Kings College London said ""I didn't realise I that I could drop off the register due to the individual voter registration. I didn't have my National Insurance number with me and had to rush off to a lecture, but will make sure I register myself when I get home and will spread the word to other students. This is a really important issue. It's vital that more people know about it.""

The Labour Party's leadership supported today's action for free education. Jeremy Corbyn, the party's new leader, has expressed strong support for education as a right, not a privilege and John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, addressed the rally. McDonnell said, ""Education is a basic human right. It is not something to be bought and sold. This generation will teach the Tories that we will not stand by and allow them to destroy your futures.""

After McDonnell's speech, Momentum, alongside student Labour activists, signed up new members to the Labour Party, whose membership has doubled in the last six months in a wave of enthusiasm brought on by the Party's leadership election and Jeremy Corbyn's victory in it.

Poppy Camus, a 21 year-old student of European Studies at Kings College London said, ""Since Jeremy Corbyn came into power, I suddenly feel that joining the Labour Party may be a way I can make positive change and express myself politically.""

Emma Rees, a Momentum organiser, explained the importance of the day for the organisation, ""Students and young people have been some of the worst hit by austerity over the last five years and now student areas are likely to receive less representation in Parliament. We must stand with students to protect their rights and demand free education, open to all. John McDonnell's speech demonstrated how the Labour Party is becoming the natural home for a considerable number in the student movement and we are delighted to see so many joining the Party.""

Shelly Asquith, Vice President Welfare, the National Union of Students, and Momentum supporter said, ""The student movement is a leading progressive force in the UK. That's why it's so crucial that we keep up our fight for the fairer society we want to live in and get registered to stop the Tory attack on democracy through changes to voter registration. I am delighted that Labour's leadership, and its supporters in Momentum, were here today standing shoulder to shoulder with us.""",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/PeoplesMomentum/photos/a.160217227657006.1073741829.155710354774360/171372073208188/?type=3,2015-11-05 04:44:07,363,6,101,363,0,0,0,0,0

""Congratulations on your demonstration today.
 
I opposed the imposition of fees, and each increase, and I opposed the removal of maintenance grants ‚Äì as did many others ‚Äì and now we have an opportunity to change course, and to change Labour into a force that represents students' desire for free and accessible education.

Switching back to a loan in place of a maintenance grant will push the poorest students into higher levels of debt. 

We must also look again at restoring EMA and increasing college places, so all young people have the opportunity to go to further education and, if they wish, on to higher education too.

There are no student fees in Scotland, Germany and twelve other European countries, I want to bring all UK students into line with that sensible approach.

We all benefit from education, collectively as a society, not just as individuals. 

Keep protesting, keep campaigning for justice. Education is a right, not a privilege.""

""Thousands of young people are expected to take to the streets of central London this week to voice their anger over the government's ""attacks on free education"", in what organisers are describing as a resurgent movement of student protest following the Conservatives's election victory in May.

Organisers of the march on 4 November, called to protest against plans to axe the remaining education maintenance grants, also say that increasing numbers of students have attended meetings at universities and colleges since Jeremy Corbyn's election as Labour leader in September.

""Events that six or 12 months ago were attracting 10 or a dozen activists are now seeing hundreds of people turn up,"" said Deborah Hermanns, from the National Campaign Against Fees and Cuts, which has organised the London demonstration.""

""This caricature of the 'hard left' is being peddled out by the media and some Labour MPs in a bid to discredit Momentum. The fear of the unknown and the dread that there may be a layer of new and enthusiastic activists ready to build a movement for social justice is palpable.

What became clear from the interview and discussions about the various groups being set up is that Momentum really is capturing the excitement, optimism and desire to build the movement that the Jeremy Corbyn campaign sparked. And crucially that it is bringing people to politics that have not been involved before.""

An estimated 1.9million people are set to drop off the electoral register because of the government's introduction of 'individual electoral registration'.

In the past, one person could register on everyone's behalf, government changes mean that each individual needs to register themselves. Many won't.

Another 8 million people are already missing from the register. That's almost 1 in 5 adults without the vote. That's not democracy.

Who is this most likely to affect?

- Young people (only 25% of 17 year-olds are on the register)
- Students
- People in temporary or shared housing
- People who are new to the country

""On October 24, a nationwide voter registration campaign will be launched by Momentum, the movement born out of the surge in support for Jeremy Corbyn.

The campaign ‚Äì Democracy SOS ‚Äì will kick off with a day of action, with organisers engaging people in university campuses and town centres, handing out information about the importance of voting and how to register.

They say there is a serious risk that one in every five people in the UK could drop off the electoral register and be disenfranchised on December 1, missing out on a raft of crucial elections in 2016. 

Previously, under the 'head of household' system, one person in each house could register anyone at that address who was eligible to vote, and universities could register students by their halls of residence. This is no longer the case. Now every student has to register individually, not always a priority for students who are under so many other pressures.""

""What do a former Manchester United player and the pope have in common? Quiet at the back: both have better opinions on and approaches to squatting than the current government.

Gary Neville succeeded in winning over half the country, and even the most fervent Manchester City supporters, this weekend after telling homeless squatters who'd taken up residence in the former stock exchange building he owns that they could stay for the winter. Not just that, he'd help them find homes as long as they allowed access for the staff developing the building, owned by Neville and Ryan Giggs, into a boutique hotel.""

Momentum claim that a further 8 million adults may not be on the register at all, meaning that 1o million will not be able to use their vote in next May's elections.

The switch to individual electoral registration will see an estimated 1.9 million people drop off the electoral register in December. A large city like Birmingham could lose more than 67,000 voters.

155710354774360_164081953937200,"Momentum announces its first national campaign - Democracy SOS

On Saturday 24 October, activists around the country will kick off Momentum's national voter registration campaign with a coordinated day of action.

Momentum, the new grassroots network arising out of the Jeremy Corbyn for Labour leader campaign, has announced its first national campaign, Democracy SOS.

Changes to the electoral registration system brought forward by the Conservative government mean that an estimated 1.9 million people will drop off the electoral register on 1 December 2015. Another 8 million are not on the register at all. That's almost 1 in 5 adults without the vote. 

With critical elections due in May next year in London, Scotland, Wales, Bristol, and English councils, it is crucial that as many as possible of these potential 10 million unregistered claim their vote and their voice.

Due to planned boundary changes, people not on the electoral register by 1 December will not be counted when the Boundary Commission redraws constituency boundaries. As a result, groups most likely to not be on the electoral roll could be further under-represented at the 2020 general election.

And who is this most likely to affect?
- Young people (only 25% of 17-year-olds are on the register)
- Students
- People in temporary housing
- People who live in shared housing
- People who for whom English is not their first language

In other words, it's about to get even worse for people who are already underrepresented. Poorer areas could have relatively fewer MPs than richer areas.

Momentum, supported by the Transport Salaried Staffs' Association (TSSA), will launch Democracy SOS, its voter registration campaign, on Saturday 24 October. Local Momentum groups all across the country will be hitting the streets to tell people about the changes and giving them information to assist them in registering. Momentum groups will, where possible, work alongside local, regional and national Labour Party efforts, as well as other interested unions and organisations, on the national day of action and in subsequent local efforts.

Explaining the choice of Democracy SOS as Momentum's first national campaign, Emma Rees, one of the organisers of Democracy SOS, said:

""Jeremy Corbyn's campaign for Labour Leader put forward a new kind of politics, a politics that engaged with those shut out from the political system, promising more participatory democracy. Claiming your right to vote is a major step in politicisation, to further action at community and national level. And so, we thought that Democracy SOS was a natural choice as Momentum's first national campaign."" 

Welcoming the launch of Democracy SOS, Clive Lewis MP said:

""It is estimated that almost 2 million adults could drop off the electoral register after 1 December. In a democratic society, we absolutely have to take strong, proactive steps to prevent this from happening. I wholly support efforts of Democracy SOS.""

Sam Tarry, TSSA National Political Officer, sees the Democracy SOS campaign in the context of the broader government policies. He explained:

""Democracy is under assault from the Tories - first they came for the charities and NGO's, with the 'gagging Act', then they came for the Trade Unions with their anti-worker, pro fat-cat Trade Union Bill, and now; they are coming for you.

The Tories want to gerrymander the electoral boundaries - taking away millions of working people across Britain's chance to be counted. It's a blatant, anti-democratic stitch-up designed to keep them in power for as long as possible.

TSSA is proud to support this labour movement campaign to ensure that the missing millions are counted. Over the next few weeks we will work in communities across the country - going out and talking to people face to face, to ensure every citizen's voice is heard and will count. Join our movement - it's time to stand up and be counted"".

Individuals and groups using the Momentum name and branding must operate according to the following principles at all times:

‚Ä¢ As the successor to Jeremy Corbyn's Leadership Campaign, Momentum promotes the values that Jeremy popularised during the campaign, of fair, honest debate focused on policies, not personal attacks or harassment. 
‚Ä¢ Momentum is outward-facing. It seeks to reach out across the community and encourages the participation of people who may not have been involved in political activities before. Ensuring the safety and self-expression of everyone is a priority, especially of those who are often marginalised on the basis of their gender, sexuality, ethnicity, race, religion, class, disability and educational or economic status.
‚Ä¢ Groups of individuals may form local Momentum Groups to share ideas, organise and participate in activities at their local level which demonstrate how 'Labour values' and collective effort can make a positive social and/or environmental impact. These groups must be democratic in their nature and be organised around a spirit of collaboration, inclusion and respect.
‚Ä¢ As the successor to Jeremy Corbyn's Leadership Campaign, Momentum promotes the communication of progressive ideas for political change, such as: opposition to austerity, the promotion of equality and participatory democracy. These are the values for which Jeremy Corbyn was elected.
‚Ä¢ Momentum is wholly committed to working for progressive political change through methods which are inclusive, participatory and non-violent.
‚Ä¢ Momentum seeks to build a social movement in support of the aims of the Labour movement and a fairer and more decent society. Momentum is committed to supporting the Labour Party winning elections and entering government in 2020 and seeks positive and productive engagement with local Labour Party branches.

Individuals and/or groups who do not adhere to the above principles will not be considered to be part of, or associated with, Momentum. Please note that Momentum is its embryonic stage as a network organisation.

Jason was integral to Jeremy's Corbyn leadership campaign, taking many of the brilliant photos that were so widely shared during the summer, as well as a load of publicity materials.

Both the Corbyn campaign and this new project owes a massive debt of gratitude to people like Jason, who've been so generous with their time. 

Feel free to use these images as banners or profile pics. You can see more of Jason's work here:

""The Corbyn campaign for Labour's leadership excited and inspired so many people because at its heart contained the promise of democracy. Now we have to deliver on that promise of participatory democracy. Corbyn has already announced that Labour's policy making is going to be much more open, using new technologies and the public's skills and knowledge. Shadow Communities Secretary John Trickett is due to launch a series of Citizen's Assemblies. Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell has encouraged people to begin participatory, democratic budgeting where they can in their communities and workplaces. This is the work of building real democracy outside Westminster. That work starts now.

To deliver on this promise of participatory, the Corbyn campaign has today transformed into the Momentum movement. Momentum is a network for people inside and outside the Labour Party to organise and build a mass, democratic movement for progressive change.""

""In the short term the organisation hopes to host meetings, events, and rallies for people engaged by Corbyn's politics. Members of Momentum, which is being run by an interim committee of volunteers, believe their activist model could then provide the basis for a new form of politics if Corbyn wins the 2020 general election.

""We'd hope to demonstrate through getting organised we can get good outcomes,"" a spokesperson for the campaign told BuzzFeed News. ""By helping people to get organised and using the principles of collective co-operation and solidarity we hope to show ‚Äì on a micro scale ‚Äì how Labour if they got into government could transform the county and society on a massive scale.""

It will also form organisations along geographic lines or on issues that will enable the left-wing movement to ""deliver things now"" with the Conservatives set to remain in government for another four years. One of the first proposals is to create a Momentum-aligned campaign group for the rights of private-sector tenants which would provide legal advice and help people get back their deposits.""

""Volunteer activists in Jeremy Corbyn's leadership campaign are to try to harness the campaign's energy by setting up a new social movement to back his ideas and politics.

The campaign entitled Momentum launched on Thursday and has the approval of the Labour leader as well as John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor and campaign manager for Corbyn.

The group, being set up four weeks after Corbyn won the leadership, is designed as a grassroots network to create ""a mass movement for change, for real progressive change in every town and city"".

Momentum is describing itself as the successor to the Jeremy Corbyn for Labour Leader campaign, but it is independent of the Labour party's leadership. It will work both inside the Labour party and organise in broader civil society.""

""Be under no illusion - the powerful, the exploiters, the excessively wealthy will not pull their punches. By standing up to them, both Jeremy and the Labour Party will face an unparalleled assault that will make what happened to Ed Miliband pale into insignificance.

That's why the need for a social movement to work for a more democratic, equal and decent society inside and outside the Labour Party couldn't be greater. One that can help make the political space necessary for the new ideas we so badly need.The array of vested interests confronting us cannot be taken on by one man or even a single political party in Westminster. Instead, we need a bigger, broader, deeper alliance that can confront such powerful, vested interests.

That's why today, four weeks after ballots closed in the Labour leadership election; I'm so very pleased to announce the launch of Momentum.""

155710354774360_159607927717936,"Welcome to the Momentum Facebook page. 

Something wonderful happened this summer. After years of being told that there is no alternative to austerity, hundreds of thousands of people stood up for a new kind of politics and agreed with Jeremy Corbyn that austerity is a political choice not a necessity.

A quarter of a million people made Jeremy Corbyn Labour's Leader. And now Labour's conference has given its resounding backing to Jeremy and his Shadow Chancellor, John McDonnell, to turn Labour into an anti-austerity party of hope and bold alternatives.

We have begun to change the Labour Party but we still have to show how we can change the country. Throughout the campaign, Jeremy spoke about building a social movement to work for a more democratic, equal and decent society. Now is the time to make this a reality! 

Momentum will be our grassroots network to continue the work we have begun:

-To organise in every town, city and village to create a mass movement for real, progressive change.

-To transform Labour into a more democratic party with the policies and collective will to make that change in government.

- To bring together individuals and groups in our communities and workplaces to campaign and organise on the issues that matter to us.

Momentum will be your network; please help build it. But right now, as we begin to organise new events and campaigns, and to launch Momentum online, we need you to help us spread the word about these plans.

Begin by inviting all your Facebook friends to 'like' this page.",,status,,2015-10-08 06:01:48,2520,444,1016,2520,0,0,0,0,0
