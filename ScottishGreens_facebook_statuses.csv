-Taxing derelict and vacant land.
-Allowing local authorities to decide their own levels of Council Tax without financial penalty.
-Adjusting the Council Tax multiplier to reduce tax for lower band properties and increase it for undertaxed higher band properties.

We state that:

1. The Scottish Green Party, which is committed to making popular democracy a reality at the national, regional and local level, believes that there should in time be a second referendum on Scottish independence.

2. In that referendum the Scottish Greens will campaign for independence to secure the powers needed for a socially just and sustainable Scotland.

3. The timing of the referendum should be determined by public appetite: Scotland should decide, when Scotland wants to decide.

4. In assessing public appetite for a second referendum we will respect new kinds of citizen-led initiatives - for example, a call for a referendum signed by up to 1 million people on the electoral register.

5. For the next term of the Scottish Parliament Green MSPs will focus on using existing and forthcoming powers to deliver the changes that will make a difference to the people of Scotland - on fuel poverty, land reform, funding public services and many other challenges which need to be tackled right now.

6. We will continue to call for further powers being devolved to the Scottish Parliament until independence is achieved, for example the ability to raise the minimum wage, as supported by the Scottish Trades Union Congress.

7. We will also bring forward a radical package of ideas which demonstrates just how different and better an independent Scotland could be - on currency, welfare, foreign policy, climate change, a post-oil economy and revitalising our democracy.

Scotland can be a beacon, within these islands and beyond, for a socially just and sustainable society. Whilst there are many priorities which will require independence, there is also much that can and must be done now by the Scottish Parliament and the Scottish Government.

The same MSPs also voted against Mr Harvie's proposals:
-that the Energy Jobs Taskforce set up by the Scottish Government be given an additional explicit aim of supporting transition;
-that a transition to more sustainable industries was achievable;
-that decommissioning should be prioritised to ensure Scotland doesn't lose out to other countries on contracts for such work.

Patrick Harvie MSP, the Scottish Greens' economy and energy spokesperson, said:

""I welcome the formation of this new group campaigning for the SNP to adopt clear policy against unconventional gas. Communities across central Scotland threatened by fracking and coal gasification are being left in limbo by SNP Ministers trying to face both ways in the run up to an election. SMAUG is right to agitate for an outright ban. Ministers have the power to end this dangerous distraction right now. 
 
""Scottish Greens have been campaigning against unconventional gas extraction for years and led Holyrood's first debate on the issue. We called for a ban and all other parties voted against it. By contrast the SNP only seem able to go so far as permitting a motion at their conference which merely invites ministers to consider extending their temporary moratorium to include coal gasification. This is far short of the permanent ban that our communities want.

There were over a million votes for the combined Green parties. It's not the outcome that many of us were hoping for, but we have a lot to look forwards to.

For all those who didn't have a green candidate in their area, we're really sorry we weren't able to stand a Green candidate in your area. We are doing our best to make sure that we will be fielding a candidate in as many seats as possible for the Holyrood elections next year.  If you would like to be part of the decision-making to ensure that you get a Green candidate in future elections, I would strongly encourage you to join the party and get involved with your local branch! 

But this is not the end. Next year in the #Holyrood #SP2016 election we are polling between 10 and 12 % throughout Scotland and we will be running in every region. 

According to Patrick Harvie MSP , the ""Scottish Green campaign teams will be looking forward to mounting our biggest ever campaign, for Holyrood next year. Public polling is consistent and we intend to convert those numbers into a sizeable team of MSPs so the Green Surge transforms Scotland's parliament.""

The Scottish Greens announce today that we will stand candidates in over half of Scotland's 59 Westminster constituencies - more than ever before - with 40 per cent of the candidates women.

A full list of candidates can be found here:
http://www.scottishgreens.org.uk/campaigns/westminster2015/

This follows a surge in membership to over 8,500 and a steady rise in the polls with a recent TNS Scottish survey putting the Greens on 6 per cent, two points ahead of the Libdems. The same poll revealed that almost of a quarter of 18 to 34 year olds intend to vote for the Scottish Greens.

Edinburgh East is the top target constituency with former university rector Peter McColl the party's candidate. Edinburgh has a strong Green activist base, and has had MSPs since 1999 and councillors since 2007.

Patrick Harvie MSP, Co-convener of the Scottish Greens, said:
""Other parties are tying themselves in knots with messages about the sort of tactical voting that represents the politics of old. With our biggest slate of candidates, Scots will have an unrivalled opportunity to vote for the bold and positive politics that only Greens represent.

""Our candidates are already out and about engaging with voters on our ideas for protecting public services, reforming democracy and tackling inequality. With new members joining all the time we are determined to maintain the momentum.""

Peter McColl, Scottish Green candidate for Edinburgh East, said:
""Greens are clearly in the running as we head into an election in which everything is up for grabs. We know from speaking to our local communities that voters are looking for candidates they can believe in.

""Our policies on raising the minimum wage to £10 a hour by 2020, renationalising the railways and ending austerity have huge appeal, and are vital to rebalancing our economy and our society.""",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/ScottishGreens/photos/a.10150159085761170.306570.17999726169/10153110912001170/?type=3,2015-02-22 07:30:01,1061,62,221,1061,0,0,0,0,0

Cllr Chapman said:

17999726169_10152736988286170,"FRACKING: HARVIE URGES MINISTERS TO ADOPT TOUGHER LINE

Patrick Harvie, Green MSP for Glasgow, today (30 Sep) used Topical Questions at Holyrood to urge Scottish ministers to adopt a tougher line on fracking.

A vast swathe of Scotland, from Argyll to Aberdeenshire and from Ayrshire to East Lothian, has been earmarked by the UK Government as ripe for the controversial gas drilling technique.

Last week the UK Government agreed to pass laws to let fracking companies drill below people's homes without consent, despite a consultation showing that 99% of responses oppose such a move.

Patrick Harvie MSP said:

""Drilling for gas will add massively to the existing stocks of fossil fuels - stocks we can't afford to burn. The recent climate summit in New York has reminded us of the profound threat we face if we keep pumping greenhouse gases into the atmosphere.

""Communities across Scotland are rightly alarmed at the determination of the Tory-LibDem coalition to allow fracking. Today I urged Scottish Ministers to take a tougher line, given their recent description of fracking as an opportunity and their failure to ban it with the planning powers they already have.

""I welcome John Swinney's commitment not to replicate the UK Government's approach to drilling without consent, if the power to take action is devolved to Holyrood. However he has still not ruled out allowing fracking itself to go ahead in Scotland, and if we're going to protect communities and the environment we'll need both the power to legislate, and the political will to do so.""",,status,,2014-09-30 09:02:46,1796,86,710,1796,0,0,0,0,0

17999726169_10152719755001170,"SCOTTISH GREENS THANK OVER 3,000 NEW MEMBERS

The Scottish Greens are thanking over 3,000 new members who have joined the party since the close of polls on Thursday evening.

This means total membership has just passed the 5,000 mark. The surge is also being seen on social media. The Scottish Greens' twitter account - @scotgp - now has over 18,200 followers compared to Scottish Labour's 13,000.

Recent opinion polls have put support for the Greens on 10 per cent on the Holyrood regional vote, suggesting 11 MSPs, which would make the Scottish Greens the parliament's third largest party, one MSP ahead of the Conservatives.

In May's European election the Scottish Greens secured 108,000 votes, coming ahead of the Lib Dems in 21 of Scotland's 32 local authority areas.

Comments on social media from those joining the party include:

""Excited to be part of such a progressive movement.""
""Patrick Harvie is absolutely fantastic.""
""I've joined @scotgp to help bring about positive, sustainable change.""
""First time I've been a member of a political party.""
""Spent most of the #indyref campaign wishing green matters would get more attention.""
""Found @patrickharvie's arguments compelling throughout #indyref campaign.""
""Let's get working for a fairer Scotland.""

Commenting, Scottish Greens co-convenor Patrick Harvie MSP said:

""I want to thank the vast number of people who have been in touch over recent days to offer support, share their thoughts about the Green Yes campaign, and to join the party in their thousands – including those who voted Yes and No. We'll be going into the next election as a much bigger party than we could have imagined, and the potential clearly still exists for a dramatic realignment of Scotland's political landscape.

""There are many ideas being debated about what that realignment will result in, but the Greens have never been the kind of party where a handful of people in leadership roles impose their own decisions on the rest. Our local branches are currently debating the next steps, our national council will meet on Saturday, and our members new and old will meet at our biggest conference even on October 11th to start making our decisions together.

""One thing is very clear to me. As well as the huge numbers of Yes voters who sought the kind of radical change that Westminster is unlikely to deliver, there are also many who voted No but who share our commitment to a sustainable economy, a fair and equal society, and a renewed democratic culture.

""Making that happen will mean finding ways to work together. We have always been a party that seek to work with others where common ground exists, while still offering a robust challenge where we must on the core principles of the Green agenda. I'm very excited to know that we'll be doing so as a far bigger party in future.""

The party is now looking ahead to its conference on the 11th & 12th October in Edinburgh, set to be its largest ever.

Mr Harvie, whose party has been running its own distinct Green Yes campaign, will speak in Edinburgh alongside the First Minister, Deputy First Minister, Canon Kenyon Wright who chaired the Scottish Constitutional Convention in the 1990s, and Anum Qaisar of Muslim Friends of Labour.

Patrick Harvie MSP said:

""One of the most exciting aspects of this campaign is how broad the Yes movement has become, and Scottish Greens have played a significant part, taking our message far and wide. The level of engagement from the public is amazing and I believe the prospect of building a better democracy has been a key motivating factor.

""Yes has been a wonderful and creative movement, but this debate has already gone way beyond the Yes and No campaigns, and is now being driven by ordinary people having conversations about the kind of country they want to see.

As a recent new member of the Scottish Greens I was delighted to be invited to a meet and greet with Alison Johnstone and Patrick Harvie at the Scottish Parliament. Arriving early I was welcomed by Scottish Greens staff who warmly welcomed me and other new Greens. We were in time to sit in the gallery and observe a hotly debated motion on the future of Trident in Scotland. The motion was put forward by Patrick and was successfully argued! The chamber was full and it was a pleasure to witness democracy in action especially on such an important issue. Patrick was by far and away the best orator on the subject and he handled the dissenters very well. I was delighted when the parliament carried his motion.

After the debating action we were guided by the staff to a meeting room where we held exclusive audience with Patrick and Alison. Both were very genuine and welcoming. It was only at this point did I see the huge turnout from new Green members. The meeting room was full and there was standing room only! New Greens from all sections of society numbering over 50. It was fantastic to hear all the points from like minded people.

After 30 minutes or so we left the parliament and went to a nearby pub. I got the chance to speak to lots of the new members and to Patrick and Alison too. The enthusiasm for our Green Party is infectious and I left feeling very positive about the upcoming referendum and the annual conference.

It's hard to believe that such a landmark vote is happening in such a short time. A vote where we can really shape our future and take responsibility for ourselves. Like a young person leaving the family home we won't be abandoned by our commonwealth cousins and nor are we to blame for breaking away from years of Union. It's time to go it alone and the Greens are ready to participate in a modern and revitalised Scotland. Ready to abandon the old values and fears behind nuclear capability. Ready to allow local people to make decisions that affect local communities. Ready to look after our environment and society with greater conscience than ever before.

Amongst the absentees from the debating chamber was First Minister Salmond. Remember that September's vote isn't about him or the SNP it's about Scotland looking out for itself. Don't mistake the referendum for a personality contest but as an opportunity that future generations will be grateful for.

Under the model detailed in the paper: 

- Weekly payments are proposed of £50 to children, £100 to adults and £150 to pensioners.
- 70 per cent of households would be better off than presently. 
- Those in the lowest income bracket would benefit the most. 
- Measures of inequality would be brought in line with some of the most equal countries in the world. 
- Income earned in addition to the citizen's income would continue to be taxed progressively.

Scottish Green MSPs are paying tribute following news of the death of Independent MSP Margo MacDonald.

Patrick Harvie, Green MSP for Glasgow, said:

""I have felt deeply privileged to work with Margo MacDonald on many issues in my time as an MSP, particularly in recent years through forming the Green/Independent Group and working together on the Assisted Suicide Bill. I've always enjoyed the wit and sparkle she brought to debates in the Chamber, but she could also offer a formidable challenge when it was needed, and showed long term dedication to the causes she chose to work for.

""Margo won't now see the culmination of two debates she was deeply involved in; the referendum on Scotland's independence, and the Assisted Suicide Bill which she introduced last year. But as both these debates continue, I am certain that campaigners on all sides will recognise Margo MacDonald's contribution to Scottish public life, her vibrancy and her passion. I know I'll miss her every time I walk into the Chamber.""

Alison Johnstone, Green MSP for Lothian, said:

""Margo MacDonald was a one-off. Compassionate and brave, she was a role model for new and experienced politicians alike.

""Her no-nonsense approach was massively popular with the people in Lothian she represented so well. Regardless of party affiliations Margo's star quality was indisputable. She will be much missed.""",,status,,2014-04-04 09:10:50,68,2,9,68,0,0,0,0,0

Maggie Chapman, co-convenor of the Scottish Greens and the party's candidate for the European election, has spoken of her sadness at the death of socialist Tony Benn.

Maggie Chapman said:

""Tony Benn was a truly great man, and a hero for me as he was for so many others.

""He taught us how to be socialists; he was a ferocious fighter when necessary, but also full of humour, openness, patience, and love. He trusted working people above elites, always - the mark of a true democrat.

""Instead of being tamed by his background or ministerial experience, he learned how the British state is run for vested interests. He struck a blow against the hereditary principle and demanded radical democratisation.

""He spoke up against the UK's involvement in illegal overseas wars and was a great supporter of workers controlling their own workplaces through cooperatives.

""Tony Benn's greatest legacy is the millions he inspired, who will continue his life's struggle against elites, against war and for a more equal world.""",,status,,2014-03-14 10:13:15,34,0,4,34,0,0,0,0,0

It would be fantastic if you could make it along to help Zara spread our message, even if you can only help out for a short time. We'll be speaking to voters to find out what their concerns are as well as collecting signatures for our petition against evictions caused by the bedroom tax. This is a great opportunity to meet other Greens and get some campaigning experience with knowledgeable members on hand. Patrick Harvie MSP will be joining us in the afternoon.
 
We will also be out every Saturday and Sunday between now and polling day. The only exception to this is the weekend of the 5/6th October which is party conference. If you are not attending conference but would be interested in campaigning in Dunfermline please let me know at: ross.greer@dunbartonshiregreens.org.uk as soon as possible and we can look at organising something. Further details for future campaign days will come next week. If you are available to campaign at any point  Monday-Friday could you again please let me know as teams will be out as and when volunteers are available.

17999726169_10151865694056170,"Edinburgh Greens are seeking alternatives to what they dub a ""grow-grow-grow"" plan for Edinburgh
 
At a meeting open to the public this Thursday evening (26 September) the Greens will examine the draft Local Development Plan for the city, which is due to go live in 2015.
 
The Plan sets out the big picture for land use in the city in light of a projected growth of 68,000 households through to 2031.  To date there has been controversy about the potential loss of greenbelt land to the south and west of the city.  The Plan also nestles within the so-called ""SESPlan"" which sets the context for the wider city region and has increased the land allocation for housing to over 100,000.  SESPlan is due to be discussed between all councils in the south east of Scotland next Monday (30 September).
 
Green councillor Nigel Bagshaw said:
 
""The Local Development Plan is central to how Edinburgh will be shaped over the next 20 years.  There's a fundamental question to be addressed as to how big we want Edinburgh to be and what the consequences are for greenbelt, agriculture, transport links and the future design of neighbourhoods.
 
""Beyond those questions, the city needs to do more to make better use of existing sites and existing empty properties; and to make sure that new homes are affordable and in sufficient density to support local services like shops, healthcare and public transport.  
 
""Future generations won't thank us for making the wrong choices now.""
 
The meeting is at 7.30pm on Thursday 26 September at the Quaker Meeting House, 7 Victoria Terrace.

Patrick and I have received a huge volume of correspondence from our constituents, calling on us to support the IF campaign.

The IF campaign is a vast coalition of charities and organisations demanding an end to global hunger. You can read more about the campaign on their website.

There is no need for hunger – it is a symptom of gross inequality, not of a lack of resources. We can feed the world's population, but it will require much more assertive action than governments have been prepared to take to date.

A lot of the problem goes beyond the scope of the Scottish Parliament, but that shouldn't stop Scotland making the most of the powers it does have at its disposal.

In response to the calls of my constituents, I wrote to the First Minister, putting the demands of the campaign's supporters directly to the Scottish Government.

You can read the Minister for External Affairs and International Development's response on the link below.

Please be assured that both Patrick and I will continue to challenge the Scottish Government to do more to tackle the issues highlighted by the IF campaign.",http://www.greenmsps.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/130704-Humza-Yousaf-IF-Campaign.pdf,link,http://www.greenmsps.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/130704-Humza-Yousaf-IF-Campaign.pdf,2013-07-10 11:57:14,22,0,0,22,0,0,0,0,0

When Donald Trump offered to bring six thousand jobs and a billion pounds in investment to Scotland with two world class golf courses, a five star hotel and hundreds of homes, it seemed to many an opportunity not to be missed even though it would mean sacrificing an environmentally protected part of the Scottish coastline. Five years on from Trump's controversial planning victory one golf course has been built, the hotel and property build is on hold while the accounts show investment of around £25 million and, according to the Trump Organisation, 200 jobs have been created rather than the thousands promised. With the land estimated now to be worth around ten times what it was thanks to the outline planning consents, Panorama reporter John Sweeney asks if the Scottish Government knew enough about the self-proclaimed billionaire before saying yes and challenges Donald Trump to reveal what's behind the Trump brand.","BBC One - Panorama, The Trouble with Trump",link,http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b036yklf,2013-07-07 23:27:52,22,1,5,22,0,0,0,0,0

17999726169_10151581628171170,"Aberdeen Green Party has selected local campaigner Rhonda Reekie as its candidate to contest the Aberdeen Donside Scottish Parliament by-election.

Rhonda Reekie lives at the heart of the Aberdeen Donside constituency, in Bucksburn. An active member of the local community, Rhonda is on Bucksburn and Newhills Community Council and the Beacon Community Centre management team. Rhonda is involved in several local environmental initiatives, including the creation of a community herb garden, looking after the Old Meldrum Road flower beds and a woodland project at Sclattie Woods in co-operation with Bucksburn Academy.

Born in Lanarkshire, Rhonda, 47, moved to Aberdeen aged 11. She attended Bridge of Don Academy and went on to study molecular and cell biology at Aberdeen University. Married to Andrew, she and her husband have lived in Bucksburn for the past 13 years. Rhonda lists her hobbies as gardening, community work, reading and cookery. She works as a freight forwarding manager for a company in Aberdeen.

Rhonda is an active political campaigner; for example, she was heavily involved in the successful campaign to save Union Terrace Gardens. Rhonda has been a member of the Scottish Green Party for ten years and has previously stood as a Green candidate in council, Holyrood and Westminster elections. She is also a member of Amnesty, the League Against Cruel Sports and Friends of the Earth. Rhonda is pro-independence.

Rhonda Reekie said, ""The Green Party will be putting forward a positive message for Aberdeen Donside. We want to protect and improve the local environment. We see energy conservation and renewable energy projects, for example the wind turbine test centre in Aberdeen bay, as a route to new and sustainable jobs for the North-east. We want better public transport across the City, including improvements to the train service in and out of Aberdeen and additional stations. We will campaign for a fairer society - for example, by opposing the 'Bedroom Tax'.
