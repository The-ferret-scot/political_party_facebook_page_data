This is unusual. The SNP government usually would put out a press release about the opening of an envelope. But days after the deal was signed, the top news stories on the government website were on changes to dog fouling fines and an update on the Scottish beaver population.

Soon afterwards, newspaper reports linked one of the firms involved with corruption and human rights abuses. Now the Scottish Government say they won't publish correspondence on the controversial agreement until after the election.

It takes ten years to train a GP. It takes four years to train a nurse or a teacher. And it takes two years to train a police officer.

Yet Ministers sitting in government towers like to think they know best. Do they know how to treat patients better than nurses and doctors? Or how to prevent crime in our communities better than police? Or how to teach children better than teachers?

The SNP's target culture has heaped more and more pressure onto our public services and morale has hit rock bottom.

But by scrapping plans for the new national tests, which will only increase teacher stress, we will be reducing their already heavy workloads. By protecting workers who whistle blow on risky practices, we will be protecting Scottish communities and promoting transparency. And by creating the post of a Minister for Public Workforce Empowerment we will enshrine empowerment across all levels of government and reduce form-filling for staff.

A presumption against prison sentences of three months or less was introduced in Scotland in 2010. As part of our manifesto proposals for the Holyrood elections in May, Liberal Democrats will put forward an extension of the presumption to cover sentences of 12 months or less.

59% of offenders given jail sentences of three months or less reoffend with one year. Reconviction rates for people given a community sentence are more than 10% lower than those released from prison.

Our policy would reduce reoffending, as well as cut the prison population and save millions of pounds. New figures secured by Ms McInnes show that the average cost of a community sentence such as a Community Payback Order is £1,900, compared to £37,000 for a prisoner place.

Under the plans, prison terms for those committing serious crimes would remain alongside tough community justice programmes for those no longer given custodial sentences.

Ms McInnes said: ""The ministerial responses to the questions I've asked are so deafening in their silence you'd think the plans had been quietly shelved. It's becoming practically a monthly occurrence – I question John Swinney and he barely responds. 

""It has been almost a year since ministers published their proposals, ones we believe could lead to identity cards being introduced in this country.

Our analysis shows that in Glasgow, local services could face a £1bn hit to already stretched resources. In the Highland's, this would represent a cut of over £356m.

The SNP have centralized the life out of Scotland. Their full fiscal autonomy plans would flatline the beating heart of local communities.

This shows why, on May 7th, people need to vote Liberal Democrat in each of our eleven held seats so that we can stop the SNP and guarantee the economic recovery for all.

Speaking on the campaign trail in East Dunbartonshire today, Jo said:   

""It is a failure to our young people that over 250 faced waits of over a year for treatment at CAMHS services across Scotland. Waiting twelve months is too long for anyone, but for a young person it will feel like a lifetime.

""Our plans would enable more young people to get the urgent treatment they need. It would give them the opportunity they need to get on in life. This is a Liberal Democrat plan because it builds a stronger economy and a fairer society.""

Commenting on the report from HM Inspectorate of Constabulary in Scotland on the controversial policy, Alison said:

""The HMICS report makes clear that the decision to enable armed officers to overtly carry sidearms while undertaking routine duties was not subject to robust scrutiny prior to its introduction on day one of the new national force. It wasn't discussed at key meetings between the police and SPA and those tasked with scrutinising such changes only considered its impact once the public concern about the way they were being policed was highlighted by newspapers and community campaigns. We need assurances that this backwards approach to scrutiny will not be repeated in future.""

Today at Holyrood, Willie Rennie told the First Minister that there could be few better uses for this money that helping ensure that children have the chance to get on in life.

Commenting, Liberal Democrat education spokesman Liam McArthur MSP said:

""This report lays bare the impact of SNP cuts on Scotland's colleges. In the space of one year there are 48,000 fewer student places, 1,000 fewer full-time equivalent college staff and five million fewer hours of learning being delivered.""
