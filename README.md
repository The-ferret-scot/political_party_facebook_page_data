# UK political party facebook page data
This repository contains 16 CSV files scraped from the Facebook Page API. Each file corresponds to a UK or Scottish Political Party or party leader Facebook Page. 
All of the files contain details of every post to each page, including the full text of the post, plus data on the number of reactions, comments and shares, up to January 2017, when the data was scraped.
As it can be difficult to manually search Facebook, you can use these files to quickly search for keywords to find out what a political party were saying at a particular time.
The files also make it easy to conduct more sophisticated analyses of posts in bulk. 
If you make use of the files, and publish something based on the information in them, we'd love to know about it. We'd also be really grateful if you could mention The Ferret, and link to our website at https://theferret.scot
